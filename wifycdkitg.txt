Sure! Here is a simple program in Python to calculate the average of a list of numbers:

```python
# Function to calculate the average of a list of numbers
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = sum(numbers)
    average = total / len(numbers)
    return average

# List of numbers
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# Calculate the average of the list of numbers
result = calculate_average(numbers)

print(f"The average of the numbers is: {result}")
```

You can input your list of numbers in the `numbers` variable and the program will calculate and print the average of those numbers.
