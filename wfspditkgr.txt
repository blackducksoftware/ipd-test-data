Prompt: "Can you write a program in Python that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list?"

LLM-generated code:

```python
def sum_even_numbers(nums):
    sum_even = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            sum_even += num
    return sum_even

# Test the function with a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print(sum_even_numbers(numbers))
```
