Here is a Python program that achieves this:

```python
def filter_even_numbers(input_list):
    even_numbers = [num for num in input_list if num % 2 == 0]
    sum_even_numbers = sum(even_numbers)
    return even_numbers, sum_even_numbers

input_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
even_numbers, sum_even_numbers = filter_even_numbers(input_list)

print("Original List:", input_list)
print("Even Numbers:", even_numbers)
print("Sum of Even Numbers:", sum_even_numbers)
```

You can run this program with any list of integers as input. It will return a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list and calculate the sum of the even numbers in the original list.
