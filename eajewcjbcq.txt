Here is a Python script that accomplishes the task:

```python
def sort_file(input_file, output_file):
    data = []
    
    # Read input file line by line and store data in a list
    with open(input_file, 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            data.append(line.strip())
    
    # Sort the list in reverse order
    data.sort(reverse=True)
    
    # Write the sorted data to an output file
    with open(output_file, 'w') as f:
        for item in data:
            f.write(item + '\n')
            
# Example usage
input_file = 'input.txt'
output_file = 'output.txt'
sort_file(input_file, output_file)
```

You can save this script in a Python file (e.g., `sort_file.py`) and run it by providing an input file (`input.txt` in this case) and an output file where the sorted data will be written. Make sure to adjust the file names accordingly in the script.
