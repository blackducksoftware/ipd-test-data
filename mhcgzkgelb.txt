Here's an example Python program that accomplishes this task:

```python
import statistics

def calculate_stats(input_list):
    try:
        if not input_list:
            raise ValueError("Input list is empty")
        
        numbers = [float(num) for num in input_list]
        
        mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

        median = statistics.median(numbers)

        mode = statistics.multimode(numbers)

        print(f"Mean: {mean}")
        print(f"Median: {median}")
        print(f"Mode(s): {', '.join([str(m) for m in mode])}")

    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
    except statistics.StatisticsError:
        print("Error: No mode found in the input list")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")

# Test the program
test_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6]
calculate_stats(test_list)
```

This program defines a function `calculate_stats` that takes a list of numbers as input, calculates the mean, median, and mode using the `statistics` module in Python, and then displays the results. It includes error handling for empty lists, non-numeric values, and cases where there are no mode found in the input list. Finally, it tests the program with a sample list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6]`.
