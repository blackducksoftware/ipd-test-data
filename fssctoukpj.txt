Here is an example program in Python:
```python
def sum_of_even_numbers(numbers):
    sum = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            sum += num
    return sum

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
result = sum_of_even_numbers(numbers)
print(f"The sum of all even numbers in the list is: {result}")
```

This program defines a function `sum_of_even_numbers` that takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the sum of all even numbers in the list. It then demonstrates the function with a sample list of numbers and prints out the result.
