Here is a Python program that fulfills the given prompt:

```python
def sum_even_numbers(numbers):
    total = 0
    
    for num in numbers:
        if isinstance(num, int):
            if num % 2 == 0:
                total += num
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid input. Please provide a list of integers.")

    return total

# Example input
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

try:
    result = sum_even_numbers(numbers)
    print(f"The sum of even numbers in the list is: {result}")
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)
```

This Python program defines a function `sum_even_numbers` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list. It includes error handling to ensure that the input is valid (i.e., a list of integers). The program then demonstrates the function by calculating the sum of even numbers in the example input list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.
