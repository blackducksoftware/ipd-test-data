Sure! Here is a Python program that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of all prime numbers in the list:

```python
def is_prime(num):
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, num):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def sum_of_primes(numbers):
    sum_primes = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if is_prime(num):
            sum_primes += num
    return sum_primes

# Input list of numbers
numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 13, 15]

# Calculate the sum of all prime numbers in the list
result = sum_of_primes(numbers)

print(f"The sum of all prime numbers in the list is: {result}")
```

You can customize the list of numbers by changing the `numbers` variable in the code. This program will output the sum of all prime numbers in the input list.
