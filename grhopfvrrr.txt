Here is a Python program that takes a list of numbers as input and outputs the sum of all the numbers in the list:

```python
def calculate_sum(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total

# Input list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Calculate the sum of the numbers in the list
result = calculate_sum(numbers)

# Output the sum
print("Sum of numbers in the list:", result)
```

You can modify the `numbers` list with any list of numbers to calculate the sum.
