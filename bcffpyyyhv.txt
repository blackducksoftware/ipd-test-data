Sure! Here's an example script that achieves the task you described:

```python
import pandas as pd

try:
    # Read the CSV file 'data.csv' into a DataFrame
    df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
    
    # Extract the 'name' column from the DataFrame
    names = df['name'].unique().tolist()
    
    # Print the list of unique values in the 'name' column
    print(names)
    
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: The file 'data.csv' was not found.")
except KeyError:
    print("Error: The 'name' column was not found in the CSV file.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")
```

You can run this script in a Python environment with the 'pandas' library installed to read the CSV file and output the unique values in the 'name' column. Make sure to replace 'data.csv' with the actual path to your CSV file. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
