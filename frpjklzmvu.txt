Here's a Python program that does that:

```python
def sum_of_even_numbers(numbers):
    sum_even = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            sum_even += num
    return sum_even

# Example
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print("Input numbers:", numbers)
print("Sum of even numbers:", sum_of_even_numbers(numbers))
```

You can run this program with any list of numbers as input and it will calculate the sum of all even numbers in the list.
