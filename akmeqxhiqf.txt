Sure! Here is a prompt you can use to ask LLM to generate 20+ lines of code in Python:

"Can you generate a Python program that reads in a list of numbers from the user, calculates the average of those numbers, and then outputs the average along with the highest and lowest numbers in the list?" 

Feel free to modify the prompt to fit your specific needs or preferences.
