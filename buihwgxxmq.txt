```python
def filter_even_numbers(input_list):
    even_numbers = [num for num in input_list if num % 2 == 0]
    even_sum = sum(even_numbers)
    return even_numbers, even_sum

input_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
even_numbers_list, even_sum = filter_even_numbers(input_list)

print("Even numbers from the original list:", even_numbers_list)
print("Sum of even numbers in the new list:", even_sum)
```

This program will take the input list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, filter out the even numbers, and then print the new list of even numbers along with the sum of all even numbers in the list.
