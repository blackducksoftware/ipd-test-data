Here is a simple implementation of a Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python:

```python
import random

def get_user_choice():
    user_choice = input("Enter your choice (Rock, Paper, Scissors): ").lower()
    while user_choice not in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:
        print("Invalid choice. Please choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors.")
        user_choice = input("Enter your choice (Rock, Paper, Scissors): ").lower()
    return user_choice

def get_computer_choice():
    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']
    return random.choice(choices)

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return "It's a tie!"
    elif (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or \
         (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock') or \
         (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper'):
        return "You win!"
    else:
        return "Computer wins!"

def play_game():
    while True:
        user_choice = get_user_choice()
        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
        print("Computer chose:", computer_choice)
        
        result = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)
        print(result)
        
        play_again = input("Do you want to play again? (yes/no): ").lower()
        if play_again != 'yes':
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    play_game()
```

To run this program, simply copy and paste the code into a Python interpreter or a Python file and execute it. You can play the Rock, Paper, Scissors game against the computer following the prompts. The game will continue until you decide to quit by entering "no" when prompted.
