Here is a Python program that accomplishes the above task:

```python
def sum_even_and_avg_odd(numbers):
    even_sum = 0
    odd_count = 0
    odd_sum = 0

    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            even_sum += num
        else:
            odd_count += 1
            odd_sum += num

    if odd_count == 0:
        avg_odd = 0
    else:
        avg_odd = odd_sum / odd_count

    return even_sum, avg_odd

# Sample input list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

even_sum, avg_odd = sum_even_and_avg_odd(numbers)

print(f"Sum of even numbers: {even_sum}")
print(f"Average of odd numbers: {avg_odd}")
```

You can run this program with any list of integers as input to calculate the sum of even numbers and average of odd numbers in the list.
