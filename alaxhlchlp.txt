Here is a Python program that calculates the average of a list of numbers:

```
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = sum(numbers)
    average = total / len(numbers)
    return average

# Example list of numbers
numbers_list = [3, 6, 9, 12, 15]

# Calculate the average of the numbers in the list
average = calculate_average(numbers_list)

print("The average of the numbers list is:", average)
```

This program defines a function `calculate_average` that takes a list of numbers as input, calculates the sum of the numbers in the list, divides the sum by the number of elements in the list to calculate the average, and returns the average. It then creates an example list of numbers and calculates the average using the `calculate_average` function, and prints the result.
