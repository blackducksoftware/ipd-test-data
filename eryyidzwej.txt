Prompt: "Write a program in Python that simulates a dice rolling game where the player rolls two dice and tries to get a total sum of 7. The program should keep track of the number of rolls the player takes to reach a sum of 7, and display the average number of rolls it takes to win the game after running it multiple times."

LLM's response may be:
```python
import random

def roll_dice():
    return random.randint(1, 6)

def dice_game():
    sum = 0
    rolls = 0
    while sum != 7:
        dice1 = roll_dice()
        dice2 = roll_dice()
        sum = dice1 + dice2
        rolls += 1
    return rolls

def main():
    num_games = 1000
    total_rolls = 0
    for _ in range(num_games):
        total_rolls += dice_game()
    average_rolls = total_rolls / num_games
    print(f"Average number of rolls to win the game: {average_rolls}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This program simulates a dice rolling game where the player rolls two dice and tries to get a sum of 7. It runs the game multiple times, calculates the average number of rolls to win, and then displays the result.
