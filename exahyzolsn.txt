Sure! Here is an implementation of the insertion sort algorithm in Python for sorting a list of integers in descending order:

```python
def insertion_sort_desc(arr):
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        key = arr[i]
        j = i - 1
        while j >= 0 and key > arr[j]:
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
            j -= 1
        arr[j + 1] = key

    return arr

# Example usage
arr = [4, 2, 7, 1, 9, 5]
sorted_arr = insertion_sort_desc(arr)
print(sorted_arr)  # Output: [9, 7, 5, 4, 2, 1]
```

This program defines a function `insertion_sort_desc` that takes in a list of integers `arr` and uses the insertion sort algorithm to sort the list in descending order. The algorithm works by iterating over each element in the list and inserting it into its correct position in the sorted subarray to the left of it.

You can test the implementation with the example list `arr` and verify that the sorting works correctly.
