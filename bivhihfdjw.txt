Sure! Here's an example function in Python that accomplishes that task:

```python
def sum_even_numbers(lst):
    sum_even = 0
    try:
        for num in lst:
            if num % 2 == 0:
                sum_even += num
        return sum_even
    except TypeError:
        print("Error: Please provide a list of numbers.")
```

You can call this function by passing in a list of numbers like this:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print(sum_even_numbers(numbers))
```

This will output:

```
12
``` 

This function will iterate through the list of numbers and add up all the even numbers. Additionally, it includes error handling to catch any TypeError that may occur if a non-numeric value is passed to the function.
