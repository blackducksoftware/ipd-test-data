Sure, here is an example program in Python that takes a list of numbers as input and outputs the sum of all the even numbers in the list:

```python
def sum_of_even_numbers(numbers):
    sum_even = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            sum_even += num
    return sum_even

# Example input list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Output the sum of even numbers in the list
print(sum_of_even_numbers(numbers))
```

This program defines a function `sum_of_even_numbers` that takes a list of numbers as input, calculates the sum of all the even numbers in the list, and returns the result. The example input list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]` is used to demonstrate the functionality of the program.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
