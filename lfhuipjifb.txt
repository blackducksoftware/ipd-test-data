Here is a Python program that takes in a list of names and sorts them alphabetically using the bubble sort algorithm:

```python
def bubble_sort(names):
    n = len(names)
    
    for i in range(n):
        swapped = False
        
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if names[j] > names[j+1]:
                names[j], names[j+1] = names[j+1], names[j]
                swapped = True
        
        if not swapped:
            break
    
    return names

# Input list of names
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Eve"]

# Sort the names using bubble sort
sorted_names = bubble_sort(names)

# Print the sorted list of names
print("Sorted names:", sorted_names)
```

This program defines a function `bubble_sort` that implements the bubble sort algorithm to sort a list of names. It then takes an input list of names, sorts them using the `bubble_sort` function, and prints the sorted list of names.
