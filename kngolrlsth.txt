Here is a sample code for the program that calculates the average of a list of numbers input by the user:

```python
def calculate_average(num_list):
    total = sum(num_list)
    average = total / len(num_list)
    return average

num_elements = int(input("Enter the number of elements in the list: "))
num_list = []

for _ in range(num_elements):
    num = float(input("Enter a number: "))
    num_list.append(num)

avg = calculate_average(num_list)

print(f"The average of the list of numbers is: {avg}")
```

You can copy paste this code into a Python interpreter and run it to calculate the average of a list of numbers provided by the user.
