Here is a Python program that takes user input for a number n and generates a list of the first n Fibonacci numbers in ascending order:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    fib_list = []
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        fib_list.append(a)
        a, b = b, a + b
    return fib_list

def main():
    n = int(input("Enter a number n: "))
    fib_numbers = fibonacci(n)
    print(f"The first {n} Fibonacci numbers in ascending order are:")
    print(fib_numbers)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

You can run this program in a Python environment and input a number n to generate the list of the first n Fibonacci numbers in ascending order. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
