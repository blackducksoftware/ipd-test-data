Sure! Here is a prompt you can use to ask LLM to generate 20+ lines of code in Python:

Prompt: Write a program in Python that simulates a simple game of rock-paper-scissors. The program should allow the user to input their choice of rock, paper, or scissors, and then randomly generate a choice for the computer. The program should then determine the winner based on the rules of the game and display the result to the user. The program should continue to play rounds until the user chooses to quit. The program should also keep track of the number of wins, losses, and ties for the user.

You can adjust the prompt as needed for different programming languages or requirements.
