```python
def sum_of_even_numbers(numbers):
    sum = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            sum += num
    return sum

# Input list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Calculate sum of even numbers
result = sum_of_even_numbers(numbers)

print(f"Sum of even numbers in the list: {result}")
```

Output:
Sum of even numbers in the list: 30
