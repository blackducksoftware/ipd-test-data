Sure! Here is a Python program that accomplishes the task described in the prompt:

```python
# Function to calculate square of a number
def square_number(num):
    return num * num

# Function to remove negative numbers from a list
def remove_negatives(input_list):
    return [x for x in input_list if x >= 0]

# Function to calculate squares of numbers in a list
def calculate_squares(input_list):
    squared_list = [square_number(x) for x in input_list]
    return squared_list

# Main function to take input, remove negatives, and calculate squares
def main():
    # Take input of list of numbers from user
    input_list = list(map(int, input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ").split()))

    # Remove negative numbers from the list
    input_list = remove_negatives(input_list)

    # Calculate squares of the remaining numbers
    squared_list = calculate_squares(input_list)

    # Output the squared list
    print("Squared list of numbers:", squared_list)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

When you run this program and input a list of numbers, it will first remove any negative numbers from the list and then calculate and output the squares of the remaining numbers. Each section of the code is commented for clarity.
