Here's the Python function I generated based on your prompt:

```python
def sum_of_even_numbers(input_list):
    # Initialize a variable to store the sum of even numbers
    sum_of_evens = 0
    
    # Iterate through each element in the input list
    for num in input_list:
        # Check if the number is even
        if num % 2 == 0:
            # Add the even number to the sum
            sum_of_evens += num
    
    return sum_of_evens

# Test the function with a sample input list
sample_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print(sum_of_even_numbers(sample_list))  # Output: 30
```

This function will take a list of integers as input, iterate through each number in the list, and sum up all the even numbers. You can test it with the sample input list provided above. Let me know if you need any further modifications or details!
