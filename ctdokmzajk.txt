```python
def sum_of_evens(numbers):
    sum = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            sum += num
    return sum

# Get the list of numbers as input
numbers = list(map(int, input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ").split()))

# Calculate the sum of even numbers
result = sum_of_evens(numbers)

# Output the result
print("The sum of all even numbers in the list is:", result)
```

Example:
```
Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: 1 2 3 4 5 6
The sum of all even numbers in the list is: 12
```
