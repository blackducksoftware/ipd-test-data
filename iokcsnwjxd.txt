Sure, here is a Python program that calculates the sum of numbers in a list:

```python
def sum_of_numbers(input_list):
    try:
        total = sum(input_list)
        return total
    except TypeError:
        return "Error: Input is not a valid list of numbers"

# Test the program with a list of numbers
input_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(sum_of_numbers(input_list))

# Test the program with an invalid input
invalid_input = "abc"
print(sum_of_numbers(invalid_input))
```

This program calculates the sum of numbers in the input list and handles cases where the input is not a valid list of numbers. Let me know if you need any further modifications or assistance.
