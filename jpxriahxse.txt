Here is a Python program that reads a list of numbers from the user, calculates the average, and displays the minimum and maximum numbers:

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = sum(numbers)
    average = total / len(numbers)
    return average

def find_min(numbers):
    return min(numbers)

def find_max(numbers):
    return max(numbers)

numbers = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ").split()
numbers = [int(num) for num in numbers]

average = calculate_average(numbers)
minimum = find_min(numbers)
maximum = find_max(numbers)

print("Average:", average)
print("Minimum:", minimum)
print("Maximum:", maximum)
```

You can run this program in a Python environment and enter the list of numbers when prompted. The program will calculate the average, display the minimum, and maximum numbers from the list.
