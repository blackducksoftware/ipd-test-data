Here's a Python code snippet for the prompt you provided:

```python
def sum_even_numbers(numbers):
    even_sum = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            even_sum += num
    return even_sum

user_input = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ")
numbers = [int(num) for num in user_input.split()]

result = sum_even_numbers(numbers)
print(f"The sum of all even numbers in the list is: {result}")
```

This code defines a function `sum_even_numbers` that takes in a list of numbers, iterates through the list to find even numbers, and calculates the sum of all even numbers. Then, it prompts the user to input a list of numbers, calls the `sum_even_numbers` function with the input, and prints out the result.
