Here is a prompt you can ask LLM for generating code in Python: 

"Write a Python program that takes a list of numbers as input, sorts the list in descending order, and then calculates the sum of the first 10 elements of the sorted list. Finally, print the sum. Make sure to handle any potential errors in the input."

This prompt should generate at least 20 lines of Python code from LLM.
