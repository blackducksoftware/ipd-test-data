Certainly! Here is a simple Python program that generates a Fibonacci sequence of a specified length:

```python
def fibonacci_sequence(length):
    sequence = []
    
    if length <= 0:
        return sequence
    elif length == 1:
        return [0]
    elif length == 2:
        return [0, 1]
        
    sequence = [0, 1]
    
    for i in range(2, length):
        next_num = sequence[i-1] + sequence[i-2]
        sequence.append(next_num)
        
    return sequence

# specify the length of the Fibonacci sequence
length = 10

# generate and print the Fibonacci sequence
result = fibonacci_sequence(length)
print(result)
```

You can change the value of the `length` variable to specify the desired length of the Fibonacci sequence. This program will generate and print the Fibonacci sequence of that length.
