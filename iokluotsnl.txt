Sure! Here is an example of a Python program that calculates the factorial of a given number:

```python
def factorial(num):
    if num < 0:
        return "Factorial is not defined for negative numbers"
    elif num == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        result = 1
        for i in range(1, num + 1):
            result *= i
        return result

# Get user input
num = int(input("Enter a number to calculate its factorial: "))

# Calculate factorial
print(f"The factorial of {num} is: {factorial(num)}")
```

You can run this program in a Python environment and enter a number to calculate its factorial.
