Sure! Here is an example of a Python code generated by LLM for the text-based maze game simulation:

```python
import random

# Maze dimensions
maze_size = 5

# Initialize maze grid
maze = [[random.choice([' ', '#']) for _ in range(maze_size)] for _ in range(maze_size)]

# Set player's starting position
player_pos = [0, 0]

# Set goal position
goal_pos = [maze_size-1, maze_size-1]

# Display maze function
def display_maze():
    for i in range(maze_size):
        for j in range(maze_size):
            if [i, j] == player_pos:
                print('P', end=' ')
            else:
                print(maze[i][j], end=' ')
        print('')
    print('')

# Main game loop
while player_pos != goal_pos:
    display_maze()

    move = input("Enter your move (up, down, left, right): ").lower()

    new_pos = player_pos.copy()
    if move == 'up':
        new_pos[0] -= 1
    elif move == 'down':
        new_pos[0] += 1
    elif move == 'left':
        new_pos[1] -= 1
    elif move == 'right':
        new_pos[1] += 1

    if 0 <= new_pos[0] < maze_size and 0 <= new_pos[1] < maze_size and maze[new_pos[0]][new_pos[1]] != '#':
        player_pos = new_pos
    else:
        print("Invalid move. Please try again.")

print("Congratulations! You have reached the goal.")
```

This code simulates a simple text-based maze game where the player controls a character moving through a randomly generated maze. The player's goal is to reach the end of the maze while avoiding obstacles represented by '#' symbols. The player can input their movements (up, down, left, or right) and is prompted to try again if they try to move into an obstacle or outside of the maze boundaries. The game ends when the player reaches the goal cell at the bottom right corner of the maze.
