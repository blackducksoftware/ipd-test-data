Prompt: Write a program that takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list.

LLM Response: 

```python
def sum_even_numbers(nums):
    total = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            total += num
    return total

# Example input
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print(sum_even_numbers(numbers))
```

This Python program defines a function `sum_even_numbers` that takes a list of integers as input and iterates through the list. If the number is even (i.e. divisible by 2), it adds it to the running total. Finally, it returns the total sum of all even numbers in the list. The example input provided is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, and the program prints the result of calling `sum_even_numbers` on this input.
