```python
def sum_of_even_numbers(numbers):
    even_sum = 0
    even_found = False
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            even_sum += num
            even_found = True
    if even_found:
        return even_sum
    else:
        return "No even numbers found."

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print(sum_of_even_numbers(numbers))
```

You can test this program by providing a list of numbers as input and see if it correctly sums all the even numbers in the list!
