Here's the code in Python:

```python
def sum_even_numbers(numbers):
    even_sum = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            even_sum += num
    return even_sum

# Test the function
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
result = sum_even_numbers(numbers)
print(result)  # Output: 30
``` 

This code defines a function `sum_even_numbers` that takes a list of numbers as input, loops through each number in the list, and adds up the even numbers. Finally, it returns the sum of all even numbers.
