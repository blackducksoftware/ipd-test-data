Here is a simple program that calculates the average of a list of numbers in Python:

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = sum(numbers)
    average = total / len(numbers)
    return average

# Example list of numbers
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# Calculate the average of the list
average = calculate_average(numbers)

print("The average of the numbers is:", average)
```

You can replace the `numbers` list with your own list of numbers to calculate the average of those numbers.
