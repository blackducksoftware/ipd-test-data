Here's a simple Python program that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of all the numbers in the list:

```python
def calculate_sum(numbers):
    return sum(numbers)

# Taking input from user
input_numbers = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by space: ")

# Converting input string to list of integers
numbers_list = list(map(int, input_numbers.split()))

# Calculating sum of all numbers in the list
result = calculate_sum(numbers_list)

print("Sum of all numbers in the list: ", result)
```

You can run this program and input a list of numbers separated by spaces when prompted. The program will then calculate and display the sum of all the numbers in the list.
