```python
def factorial(n):
    if n < 0:
        return "Factorial is not defined for negative numbers"
    elif n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
result = factorial(num)
print(f"The factorial of {num} is {result}")
```

This program defines a recursive function `factorial` that calculates the factorial of a given number. The function handles edge cases such as negative numbers and zero by returning appropriate messages. The user is asked to input a number, and the program calculates and prints the factorial of that number using the recursive function.
