Sure! Here is a prompt you can ask LLM for generating code in Python:

"Write a Python program that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. The program should have a function called 'filter_even_numbers' that takes the original list as a parameter and returns the new list. Test the function with a sample list of numbers."
