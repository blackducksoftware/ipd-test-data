Here is a sample Python program that meets the prompt:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

try:
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    if num < 0:
        print("Factorial is only defined for non-negative integers.")
    else:
        result = factorial(num)
        print(f"The factorial of {num} is {result}")
except ValueError:
    print("Please enter a valid integer.")
```

This program defines a recursive function `factorial` that calculates the factorial of a given number. It then prompts the user to enter a number and calculates the factorial using the `factorial` function. It also handles any input errors gracefully by displaying an appropriate error message.
