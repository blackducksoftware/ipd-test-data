Sure! Here is a prompt you can use to generate 20+ lines of code in Python:

Prompt: Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the sum, mean, and median of the numbers.

Expected Output:
```python
# importing the statistics module
import statistics

# taking input from the user
num_list = [int(x) for x in input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ").split()]

# calculating the sum of the numbers
total_sum = sum(num_list)
print(f"Sum of the numbers: {total_sum}")

# calculating the mean of the numbers
mean_num = statistics.mean(num_list)
print(f"Mean of the numbers: {mean_num}")

# calculating the median of the numbers
median_num = statistics.median(num_list)
print(f"Median of the numbers: {median_num}")
```

This code snippet will take a list of numbers as input from the user, calculate the sum, mean, and median of the numbers, and print the results.
