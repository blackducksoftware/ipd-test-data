Output:
```
Error: 4 is not an integer.
[4, 36, 64, 100]
``` 

In this example, the input list contains integers and a string '4'. The program correctly identifies and skips the string while processing the integers. The even numbers (2, 6, 8, 10) are squared and added to the output list, which is then printed.
