Sure! Here is a prompt you can use to ask LLM for generating code in a popular programming language:

Prompt: Write a program in Python that takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the average of all the numbers in the list. The program should then print out the average rounded to two decimal places.

Feel free to modify the prompt to fit your needs or choose a different programming language if you prefer.
