Here is an example Python program that fulfills the given prompt:

```python
def calculate_stats(numbers):
    total = sum(numbers)
    avg = total / len(numbers)
    max_num = max(numbers)
    min_num = min(numbers)
    
    return total, avg, max_num, min_num

def main():
    numbers = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ")
    numbers = list(map(float, numbers.split()))

    total, avg, max_num, min_num = calculate_stats(numbers)

    print(f"Sum: {total}")
    print(f"Average: {avg}")
    print(f"Maximum: {max_num}")
    print(f"Minimum: {min_num}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this program, the user can input a list of numbers separated by spaces. We use the `split()` function to split the input string into a list of strings, and then use `map()` to convert each string to a float. We then calculate the sum, average, maximum, and minimum of the numbers using separate functions. Finally, we print out the results to the user.

To use this program, simply run it in a Python environment and follow the prompts to input the list of numbers.
