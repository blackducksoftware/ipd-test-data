For example, if the user inputs the list of numbers [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], the program will output:
```
Average: 30.0
Numbers above the average: [40, 50]
``` 

This program uses list comprehension and basic arithmetic operations to efficiently calculate the average and identify numbers above the average.
