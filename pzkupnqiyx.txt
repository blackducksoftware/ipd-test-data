Here's a Python program that takes in a list of numbers and sorts them in descending order using the quicksort algorithm:

```python
def quicksort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    else:
        pivot = arr[0]
        less = [x for x in arr[1:] if x >= pivot]
        greater = [x for x in arr[1:] if x < pivot]
        return quicksort(greater) + [pivot] + quicksort(less)

# Input list of numbers
nums = [4, 2, 7, 1, 9, 3]

# Sorting the numbers in descending order
sorted_nums = quicksort(nums)

# Printing the sorted list
print(sorted_nums)
```

When you run this program with the input list `[4, 2, 7, 1, 9, 3]`, it will output `[9, 7, 4, 3, 2, 1]`, which is the list of numbers sorted in descending order.
