That's a great prompt! Here is a possible solution to the problem in Python:

```python
def fibonacci_sequence(num_terms):
    if num_terms <= 0:
        return []
    elif num_terms == 1:
        return [0]
    elif num_terms == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    else:
        fibonacci = [0, 1]
        while len(fibonacci) < num_terms:
            fibonacci.append(fibonacci[-1] + fibonacci[-2])
        return fibonacci

num_terms = int(input("How many terms of the Fibonacci sequence do you want to generate? "))

fibonacci_sequence_result = fibonacci_sequence(num_terms)

print(f"Fibonacci sequence up to {num_terms} terms: {fibonacci_sequence_result}")
```

This program defines a function `fibonacci_sequence` that takes the number of terms as input and generates the Fibonacci sequence up to that number of terms. It then prompts the user to enter the number of terms they want to generate and prints out the Fibonacci sequence. It also handles edge cases like when the user enters a negative number or zero.

I hope you find this solution helpful! Let me know if you have any questions.
