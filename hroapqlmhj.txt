Sure, here's a prompt you can ask LLM:
Create a function in Python that takes in a list of numbers and returns a new list containing only the even numbers in the original list, multiplied by 2. The function should be named "double_even_numbers" and should have the following signature:

def double_even_numbers(numbers):
    #your code here

This prompt should generate at least 20 lines of code in Python from LLM.
