Here is a Python program that takes user input for a number and generates the Fibonacci sequence up to that number:

```python
def fibonacci_sequence(n):
    fib_sequence = []
    
    a, b = 0, 1
    while a < n:
        fib_sequence.append(a)
        a, b = b, a + b
    
    return fib_sequence

# Get user input for the number
user_input = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Generate Fibonacci sequence up to user input
result = fibonacci_sequence(user_input)

# Print the Fibonacci sequence
print("Fibonacci sequence up to", user_input, ":")
for num in result:
    print(num)
```

You can run this program and enter a number to see the Fibonacci sequence up to that number.
