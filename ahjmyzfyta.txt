Sure! Here is a Python program that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list:

```python
def sum_of_even_numbers(number_list):
    try:
        # Initialize sum variable
        sum_even = 0
        
        # Iterate through the list
        for num in number_list:
            # Check if the number is even
            if num % 2 == 0:
                sum_even += num
        
        return sum_even
    except:
        return "Invalid input. Please provide a list of numbers."

# Test the function
try:
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    print(f"Sum of even numbers in {numbers}: {sum_of_even_numbers(numbers)}")
except:
    print("An error occurred.")
```

You can run this program by providing a list of numbers as input and it will return the sum of all the even numbers in the list. If an invalid input is provided, it will return an error message.
