Certainly! Here is the Python code that accomplishes the task specified in the prompt:

```python
# List of students and their grades
students = {
    'Alice': 90,
    'Bob': 85,
    'Charlie': 75,
    'Diana': 95,
    'Eve': 88
}

# Calculate the average grade
total_grades = sum(students.values())
average_grade = total_grades / len(students)

# Find the student with the highest grade
highest_grade_student = max(students, key=students.get)
highest_grade = students[highest_grade_student]

# Print the student with the highest grade along with their grade
print(f"The student with the highest grade is {highest_grade_student} with a grade of {highest_grade}.")

# Output the dictionary of students and their grades
print("Dictionary of students and their grades:")
print(students)
```

This code will create a dictionary with key-value pairs for a list of students and their grades, calculate the average grade, and print out the student with the highest grade along with their grade.
