This Python program takes in a list of numbers as input from the user, calculates the average, median, and mode of the list using functions, and then displays the results to the user. The `statistics` module is used to compute the median and mode of the list. The user is prompted to enter a list of numbers separated by spaces, which is converted into a list of floats. The program then calculates the average, median, and mode of the input list and displays the results to the user.
