Sure! Here is a prompt you can ask LLM to generate code for:

Prompt: Create a program in Python that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list with only the even numbers multiplied by 2.

Expected Output:
```python
def multiply_even_numbers(input_list):
    output_list = []
    for num in input_list:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            output_list.append(num * 2)
    return output_list

# Example usage:
input_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
result = multiply_even_numbers(input_list)
print(result)
```

You can change the programming language or modify the prompt as needed.
