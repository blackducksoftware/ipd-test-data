Prompt: "Write a Python program that takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the sum of all prime numbers in the list."

Here is the Python code generated by LLM based on the prompt:

```python
def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def sum_prime_numbers(numbers):
    prime_sum = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if is_prime(num):
            prime_sum += num
    return prime_sum

input_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
result = sum_prime_numbers(input_numbers)
print("Sum of prime numbers in the list:", result)
```

This Python program defines two functions, `is_prime` to check if a number is prime and `sum_prime_numbers` to calculate the sum of all prime numbers in a given list. It then creates a sample list `input_numbers`, calls the `sum_prime_numbers` function with this list as input, and prints the result. Feel free to run this code and test it with your own list of numbers.
