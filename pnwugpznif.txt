add a bit for the response
Sure! Here is a prompt you can use to ask LLM for generating 20+ lines of code:

"Can you please generate a program in Python that takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the mean, median, and mode of the numbers? Additionally, the program should print out the results in an easy-to-read format. Please include error handling for cases where the input list is empty or contains invalid values. Thank you!"

Feel free to modify the prompt as needed or let me know if you would like a different type of program generated.
