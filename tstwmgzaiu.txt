Here is a Python program that takes in a list of numbers and calculates the mean, median, and mode:

```python
from statistics import mean, median, mode

def calculate_mean_median_mode(numbers):
    mean_result = mean(numbers)
    median_result = median(numbers)
    try:
        mode_result = mode(numbers)
    except StatisticsError:
        mode_result = "No mode found"
        
    return mean_result, median_result, mode_result

# Input list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

mean_result, median_result, mode_result = calculate_mean_median_mode(numbers)

print("Mean:", mean_result)
print("Median:", median_result)
print("Mode:", mode_result)
```

This program uses the `statistics` module in Python to calculate the mean, median, and mode of the list of numbers provided. The `calculate_mean_median_mode` function takes in the list of numbers and returns the mean, median, and mode as results. The program then prints out these results for the given list of numbers.
