Sure! Here is the code for the program:

```python
def filter_even_numbers(input_list):
    try:
        if not all(isinstance(num, (int, float)) for num in input_list):
            raise ValueError("Input list should only contain numbers")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)
        return []

    even_numbers = [num for num in input_list if num % 2 == 0]
    return even_numbers

# Test the function
input_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
filtered_list = filter_even_numbers(input_list)
print(filtered_list)
```

This code defines a function `filter_even_numbers` that takes in a list of numbers as input. It first checks if the input list only contains numbers (integers or floats), and if not, it raises a `ValueError`. If the input list is valid, it creates a new list `even_numbers` containing only the even numbers from the input list using list comprehension. Finally, it returns the list of even numbers.

In the test case, the function is called with an example input list `input_list`, and the filtered list is printed to the console.
