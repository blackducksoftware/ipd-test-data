LLM code generation for the prompt:

```python
def sum_even_numbers(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            total += num
    return total

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print(sum_even_numbers(numbers))
```

This code will calculate the sum of all even numbers in the given list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]` and print the result.
