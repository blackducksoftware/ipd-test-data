Sure! Here is a sample code that LLM might generate:

```python
def get_even_numbers(input_list):
    even_numbers = []
    for num in input_list:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            even_numbers.append(num)
    return even_numbers

input_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
even_numbers_list = get_even_numbers(input_list)
print("Original list:", input_list)
print("Even numbers list:", even_numbers_list)
```

This code defines a function `get_even_numbers` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers. It then creates a sample input list, calls the function with this input list, and prints both the original list and the new list containing only even numbers.
