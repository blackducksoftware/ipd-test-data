Sure! Here is a Python function that calculates the average of a list of numbers:

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    if not numbers:
        return 0
    
    total = sum(numbers)
    avg = total / len(numbers)
    return avg

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
average = calculate_average(numbers)
print("Average:", average)
```

You can use this function by passing in a list of numbers as input and it will return the average as output. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
