Sure! Here's a Python program that does just that:

```python
def sum_even_numbers(numbers_list):
    sum_even = 0
    for num in numbers_list:
        if isinstance(num, int) and num % 2 == 0:
            sum_even += num
    return sum_even

# Test the program
test_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print(sum_even_numbers(test_list)) # Output should be 12

empty_list = []
print(sum_even_numbers(empty_list)) # Output should be 0

non_numeric_list = [1, 2, "a", 4, 5]
print(sum_even_numbers(non_numeric_list)) # Output should be 6
```

You can copy and paste this code into a Python interpreter or script to run and test it. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!
