Here's a simple program in Python that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list:

```python
def sum_even_numbers(numbers):
    even_sum = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            even_sum += num
    return even_sum

# Input list of numbers
numbers = [2, 5, 8, 10, 13, 6, 9]

# Calculate sum of even numbers in the list
result = sum_even_numbers(numbers)

# Print the result
print(f"The sum of all even numbers in the list is: {result}")
```

You can run this program by copying and pasting it into a Python interpreter or a script file.
