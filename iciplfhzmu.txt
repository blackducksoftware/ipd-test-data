Prompt: Write a program in Python that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list with only the even numbers squared.

Code generated by LLM:

```python
def square_even_numbers(numbers):
    squared_even_numbers = []
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            squared_even_numbers.append(num**2)
    return squared_even_numbers

input_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
output_numbers = square_even_numbers(input_numbers)
print(output_numbers)
```
