Here is the code generated by LLM for the given prompt:

```python
def calculate_sum_of_even_numbers(numbers):
    sum_even = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            sum_even += num
    return sum_even

# Example input list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Calculate the sum of even numbers in the list
result = calculate_sum_of_even_numbers(numbers)

if result:
    print(f"The sum of even numbers in the list is: {result}")
else:
    print("There are no even numbers in the list, the sum is 0.")
```

This code defines a function `calculate_sum_of_even_numbers` that takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the sum of all even numbers in the list. It then applies this function to an example input list `numbers` and prints the result. If there are no even numbers in the list, it prints a message indicating the sum is 0.
