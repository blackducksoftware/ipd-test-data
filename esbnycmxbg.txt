Here is a Python program that takes in a list of numbers and returns a new list containing only the even numbers, sorted in descending order:

```python
def even_sorted(numbers):
    even_numbers = [x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]
    even_numbers.sort(reverse=True)
    return even_numbers

numbers = [23, 56, 11, 78, 45, 32, 41, 88]
result = even_sorted(numbers)
print(result)
```

When you run this program with the input list `[23, 56, 11, 78, 45, 32, 41, 88]`, it will output `[88, 78, 56, 32]`, which contains only the even numbers sorted in descending order.
