Sure! Here's a prompt you can ask LLM for generating 20+ lines of code in Python:

"Write a Python program that generates a Fibonacci sequence up to a user-specified number, then calculates the sum of all the even numbers in the sequence. Include error handling for invalid input and print the result."

You can adjust the prompt as needed or specify a different programming language if you prefer.
