Sure! Here is an example of a program in Python that does this:

```python
def sum_even_numbers(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            total += num
    return total

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
result = sum_even_numbers(numbers)
print("The sum of all even numbers in the list is:", result)
```

This program defines a function `sum_even_numbers` that takes a list of numbers as input. It then iterates over each number in the list and checks if it is even by dividing it by 2 and checking if there is a remainder. If the number is even, it adds it to the `total` variable. Finally, it returns the total sum of all even numbers in the list. The program then creates a list of numbers and calls the `sum_even_numbers` function with that list, printing the result.
