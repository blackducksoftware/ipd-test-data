Making sourdough bread involves a few key steps, including making a sourdough starter, mixing the dough, fermenting the dough, shaping the dough, proofing, and baking. Here is a simplified version of the process:

Making the sourdough starter:

Mix equal parts of flour and water in a jar or container and let it sit at room temperature. Feed your starter daily by discarding some and adding fresh flour and water.
After a few days, you should start to see bubbles forming, which indicates that the wild yeast in the environment has started to ferment the mixture.
Mixing the dough:

Combine your sourdough starter with more flour, water, and salt in a mixing bowl. Mix until a shaggy dough forms.
Let the dough rest for about 30 minutes to allow the flour to hydrate.
Fermenting the dough:

Perform a series of stretch-and-folds to build the gluten structure in the dough.
Let the dough ferment at room temperature for several hours, folding periodically to develop strength and flavor. The fermentation time can vary depending on the recipe.
