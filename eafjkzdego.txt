add a bit for the response
Certainly! Here's a prompt you can ask LLM for generating 20+ lines of code in Python:

"Create a program that takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the sum of all even numbers in the list. Then, output the sum along with the count of even numbers in the list. Make sure to handle any potential errors related to invalid input."

Feel free to modify the prompt as needed for your specific requirements.
