Sure! Here is a sample code generated by LLM based on your prompt:

```python
def filter_even_numbers(input_list):
    even_numbers = [num for num in input_list if num % 2 == 0]
    return even_numbers

def main():
    input_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    result = filter_even_numbers(input_list)
    print(f"Input list: {input_list}")
    print(f"Even numbers in the input list: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code defines a function `filter_even_numbers` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers. The `main` function creates an input list, calls the `filter_even_numbers` function, and prints the original list and the filtered list containing only the even numbers. You can run this code in a Python environment to see the output.
