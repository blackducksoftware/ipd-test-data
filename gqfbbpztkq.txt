Here's a program that does just that:

```python
def even_numbers_sorted_desc(numbers):
    even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
    even_numbers.sort(reverse=True)
    return even_numbers

# Test the program
numbers = [10, 5, 3, 8, 6, 12, 4, 7]
result = even_numbers_sorted_desc(numbers)
print(result)
```

The output will be:
```
[12, 10, 8, 6, 4]
```
