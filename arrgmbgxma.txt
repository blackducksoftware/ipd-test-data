Sure, here is a Python program that accomplishes that:

```python
def sum_even_numbers(nums):
    sum_even = sum(num for num in nums if num % 2 == 0)
    return sum_even

# Test the function
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print(sum_even_numbers(nums))  # Output: 30
```

In this program, the `sum_even_numbers` function takes a list of integers as input (`nums`) and uses a list comprehension to filter out the even numbers from the input list. It then calculates the sum of these even numbers using the `sum` function and returns the result.
