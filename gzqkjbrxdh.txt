Here's a sample Python program to find the average of a list of numbers:

```python
# Function to calculate average of numbers in a list
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total / len(numbers)

# Input list of numbers
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# Calculate average
average = calculate_average(numbers)

# Display result to user
print(f"The average of the numbers {numbers} is: {average}")
```

You can replace the `numbers` list with any list of numbers you want to find the average of. Just run the program, and it will calculate and display the average to the user.
