Sure, here is a prompt you can ask LLM for generating 20+ lines of code in Python:

Create a program that generates a Fibonacci sequence up to a user-defined number. The program should prompt the user to enter a number and then output the Fibonacci sequence up to that number. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The output should be displayed in a formatted list.
