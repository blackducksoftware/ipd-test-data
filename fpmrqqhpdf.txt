Here's a Python program that accomplishes the prompt you provided:

```python
def main():
    numbers = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ")
    numbers_list = list(map(float, numbers.split()))

    avg = sum(numbers_list) / len(numbers_list)
    highest = max(numbers_list)
    lowest = min(numbers_list)

    print(f"The average of the numbers is: {avg}")
    print(f"The highest number is: {highest}")
    print(f"The lowest number is: {lowest}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

You can run this program in a Python environment and input the list of numbers when prompted. The program will then calculate and output the average, the highest number, and the lowest number in the list.
