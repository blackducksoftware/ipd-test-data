Python program:

```python
def sum_of_list_numbers(numbers):
    total_sum = sum(numbers)
    return total_sum

# Taking input numbers from the user
numbers = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ").split()
numbers = [int(num) for num in numbers]

# Calculating the sum of numbers in the list
result = sum_of_list_numbers(numbers)
print("Sum of numbers in the list:", result)
```

This program first takes a list of numbers as input from the user, splits the input string into a list of integers, and then calculates the sum of all the numbers in the list using the `sum()` function. Finally, it prints out the sum of numbers in the list.
