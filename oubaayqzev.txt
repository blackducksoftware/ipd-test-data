Sure! Here is a prompt you can ask LLM:

"Write a program in Python that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list. Make sure to handle any exceptions that may occur."

This prompt should generate at least 20 lines of Python code when presented to LLM.
