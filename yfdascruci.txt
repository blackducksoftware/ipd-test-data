Here is a sample Python program that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n < 0:
        return "Factorial is not defined for negative numbers."
    elif n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

try:
    num = int(input("Enter a number to calculate its factorial: "))
    result = factorial(num)
    print(f"The factorial of {num} is {result}")
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")
```

This program defines a recursive function `factorial` that calculates the factorial of a given number. It also includes error handling for negative numbers and invalid inputs.

You can run this program in a Python interpreter or a Python IDE by copying and pasting the code.
