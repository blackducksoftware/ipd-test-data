Sure! Here's a prompt you can use to ask LLM to generate code in a popular programming language:

"Generate a program in Python that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of all the positive numbers in the list. Include error handling to check if the input is a list of numbers and handle any exceptions that may occur. The program should also include comments to explain each step of the process."

You can customize this prompt for any programming language or specific requirements you have in mind.
