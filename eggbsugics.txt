```python
import statistics

def calculate_mean(numbers):
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

def calculate_median(numbers):
    return statistics.median(numbers)

def calculate_mode(numbers):
    try:
        return statistics.mode(numbers)
    except statistics.StatisticsError:
        return "No mode found"

def main():
    numbers = input("Enter a list of numbers (separated by spaces): ").split()
    numbers = [int(num) for num in numbers]

    mean = calculate_mean(numbers)
    median = calculate_median(numbers)
    mode = calculate_mode(numbers)

    print("Mean:", mean)
    print("Median:", median)
    print("Mode:", mode)

```

To use this program, run it in a Python environment and follow the prompt to enter a list of numbers separated by spaces. The program will then calculate and display the mean, median, and mode of the given list of numbers.
