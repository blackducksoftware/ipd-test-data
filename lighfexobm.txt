```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

user_input = int(input("Enter a number to calculate its factorial: "))
result = factorial(user_input)
print(f"The factorial of {user_input} is: {result}")
```

You can run this program in a Python environment and input a number to calculate its factorial using recursion. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
