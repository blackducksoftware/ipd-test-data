Here's a Python program that achieves this:

```python
from itertools import combinations

def find_combinations(nums):
    result = []
    for r in range(2, len(nums)+1):
        for comb in combinations(nums, r):
            result.append(comb)
    return result

# Test the program with an example list of integers
nums = [1, 2, 3]
combinations_list = find_combinations(nums)
print(combinations_list)
```

This program defines a function `find_combinations` that takes a list of integers as input and returns all possible unique combinations of those integers, with each combination containing at least two numbers. The program uses the `combinations` function from the `itertools` module to generate all possible combinations of the integers in the input list. The program then iterates over different values of `r` (number of integers in each combination) to generate combinations of varying lengths. Finally, the program prints the list of all generated combinations. 

You can test this program by running it with a list of integers of your choice.
