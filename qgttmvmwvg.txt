Here's a simple Python program that generates a Fibonacci sequence of numbers up to a user-specified limit:

```python
def fibonacci(limit):
    a, b = 0, 1
    sequence = [a, b]

    while a + b <= limit:
        a, b = b, a + b
        sequence.append(b)

    return sequence

limit = int(input("Enter the limit for the Fibonacci sequence: "))
result = fibonacci(limit)

print("Fibonacci sequence up to", limit, ":")
print(result)
```

You can run this program in any Python environment and enter a limit as the user input to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to that limit.
