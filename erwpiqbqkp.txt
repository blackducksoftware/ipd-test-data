Here is a sample code in Python that simulates a deck of playing cards:

```python
import random

class Deck:
    def __init__(self):
        self.suits = ['Hearts', 'Diamonds', 'Clubs', 'Spades']
        self.values = ['2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A']
        self.deck = [{'value': value, 'suit': suit} for value in self.values for suit in self.suits]
        
    def shuffle(self):
        random.shuffle(self.deck)
        
    def deal_cards(self, num_players, num_cards):
        players = [[] for _ in range(num_players)]
        for _ in range(num_cards):
            for player in players:
                card = self.deck.pop()
                player.append(card)
        return players
    
    def display_cards(self, players):
        for i, player in enumerate(players):
            print(f"Player {i+1} cards:")
            for card in player:
                print(f"{card['value']} of {card['suit']}")
            print()
    
    def reset_deck(self):
        self.__init__()

# Create a deck object
deck = Deck()

# Shuffle the deck
deck.shuffle()

# Deal 5 cards to 4 players
players = deck.deal_cards(4, 5)

# Display the cards that have been dealt
deck.display_cards(players)

# Reset the deck and shuffle
deck.reset_deck()
deck.shuffle()
```

You can run this code in a Python environment to test the functionality of the Deck class in simulating a deck of playing cards.
