Here is a sample program in Python that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list, along with the sum of all the even numbers:

```python
def filter_even_numbers(input_list):
    even_numbers = [num for num in input_list if num % 2 == 0]
    even_sum = sum(even_numbers)
    return even_numbers, even_sum

# Taking input from the user
input_list = list(map(int, input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ").split()))

# Calling the function
result, sum_of_even_numbers = filter_even_numbers(input_list)

# Printing the new list and the sum of even numbers
print("List of even numbers:", result)
print("Sum of even numbers:", sum_of_even_numbers)
```

You can run this program in a Python environment, and it will prompt you to enter a list of numbers separated by spaces. It will then filter out the even numbers from the list and print the new list along with the sum of all the even numbers.
