Sure, here's the Python code for the program:

```python
def sum_even_numbers(numbers):
    sum_even = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            sum_even += num
    return sum_even

# Taking input from the user
input_numbers = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ")
numbers = list(map(int, input_numbers.split()))

# Calling the function and printing the result
result = sum_even_numbers(numbers)
print("The sum of all even numbers in the list is:", result)
```

You can copy and paste this code into a Python interpreter or IDE to run it. The program will prompt the user to enter a list of numbers separated by spaces and then calculate and print the sum of all even numbers in the list.
