Great prompt! I will type out the code for this program:

```python
def calculate_even_sum(numbers):
    even_sum = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            even_sum += num
    return even_sum

input_numbers = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by commas: ")
numbers_list = [int(num) for num in input_numbers.split(',')]

result = calculate_even_sum(numbers_list)
print("Sum of even numbers in the list:", result)
```

This program defines a function `calculate_even_sum` that takes in a list of numbers, loops through the list and adds up all even numbers. It then prompts the user to enter a list of numbers separated by commas, converts the input into a list of integers, calls the `calculate_even_sum` function with the input list, and finally prints out the sum of all even numbers in the list.

You can run this program in a Python environment to test it out! Let me know if you have any questions or if you need further assistance.
