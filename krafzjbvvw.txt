Certainly! Here's a Python program that accomplishes this task:

```python
def sum_of_even_numbers(input_list):
    sum_even = 0
    for num in input_list:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            sum_even += num
    return sum_even

# Test the function
input_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print(sum_of_even_numbers(input_list))  # Output should be 30
```

You can use the `sum_of_even_numbers` function to pass in any list of integers and it will return the sum of all even numbers in the list.
