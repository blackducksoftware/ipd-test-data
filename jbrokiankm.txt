Here is an example of how you can create this program in Python:

```python
import math

def factorial(num):
    try:
        num = int(num)
        if num < 0:
            print("Error: Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.")
        else:
            result = math.factorial(num)
            print(f"The factorial of {num} is {result}")
    except ValueError:
        print("Error: Input must be a valid integer.")

num = input("Enter a number to calculate the factorial: ")
factorial(num)
```

You can run this program in a Python environment and input a number to calculate its factorial. The program will handle negative numbers and non-integer inputs with appropriate error messages.
