Here is a Python program that takes in a list of numbers, calculates the mean, median, and mode:

```python
from statistics import mode, median

def calculate_mean(list):
    return sum(list) / len(list)

def calculate_median(list):
    return median(list)

def calculate_mode(list):
    return mode(list)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 25, 20, 15, 10, 5]
    
    mean = calculate_mean(numbers)
    median = calculate_median(numbers)
    mode = calculate_mode(numbers)
    
    print(f"Mean: {mean}")
    print(f"Median: {median}")
    print(f"Mode: {mode}")
```

You can replace the `numbers` list with any list of numbers to calculate the mean, median, and mode for that list.
