Below is an example program in Python that accomplishes the given task:

```python
def sum_even_numbers(num_list):
    total_sum = 0
    for num in num_list:
        if type(num) != int:
            raise TypeError("Invalid input: List must only contain numbers")
        if num % 2 == 0:
            total_sum += num
    
    return total_sum

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        numbers = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ").split()
        numbers = [int(num) for num in numbers]
        result = sum_even_numbers(numbers)
        print(f"The sum of even numbers in the list is: {result}")
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input: Please enter numbers only")
```

You can run this program in a Python environment and input a list of numbers to calculate the sum of even numbers. This program includes error handling to check for invalid input types and provides clear comments for each section of the code.
