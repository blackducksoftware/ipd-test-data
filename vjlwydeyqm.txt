Here is a sample Python program that reads a list of numbers and outputs the sum of the even numbers in the list:

```python
def sum_of_even_numbers(numbers):
    sum = 0
    for number in numbers:
        if number % 2 == 0:
            sum += number
    return sum

# Reading a list of numbers from the user
numbers = [int(x) for x in input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ").split()]

# Calculating the sum of even numbers in the list
result = sum_of_even_numbers(numbers)

print(f"The sum of even numbers in the list is: {result}")
```

You can run this program in any Python environment and input a list of numbers to get the sum of even numbers in the list. Let me know if you need further assistance with this program!
