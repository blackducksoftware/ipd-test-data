LLM Response:
```python
def square_even_numbers(input_list):
    even_numbers = [num for num in input_list if num % 2 == 0]
    squared_even_numbers = [num**2 for num in even_numbers]
    return squared_even_numbers

input_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
output_list = square_even_numbers(input_list)
print(output_list)
```
