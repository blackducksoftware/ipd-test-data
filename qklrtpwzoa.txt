Here is a Python program that accomplishes the task:

```python
def filter_even_numbers(input_list):
    even_numbers = [num for num in input_list if num % 2 == 0]
    return even_numbers

# Taking input from the user
numbers = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ").split()
numbers = [int(num) for num in numbers]

# Function call to filter even numbers
result = filter_even_numbers(numbers)

# Printing the result
print("The even numbers in the input list are:", result)
```

You can run this program and input a list of numbers separated by spaces. It will then return a new list containing only the even numbers from the input list.
