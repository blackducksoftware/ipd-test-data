Sure! Here's a prompt you can use:

"Generate a program in Python that takes in a list of numbers as input and returns a new list that contains only the even numbers from the original list. Ensure that the program includes error handling to account for invalid inputs."

Feel free to customize the prompt as needed to fit your requirements!
