Here is the Python code for the prompt you provided:

```python
def is_prime(num):
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def main():
    try:
        num = int(input("Please enter a number to check if it is prime: "))
        if num < 0:
            raise ValueError("Please enter a positive number")
        
        if is_prime(num):
            print(f"{num} is a prime number")
        else:
            print(f"{num} is not a prime number")
        
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
