Sure! Here's a simple Python program that calculates the average of a list of numbers:

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = sum(numbers)
    average = total / len(numbers)
    return average

# Example list of numbers
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# Calculate the average
avg = calculate_average(numbers)

print("The average of the numbers is:", avg)
```

You can input your list of numbers in the `numbers` variable and the program will calculate the average for you.
