Certainly! Here's a Python function that calculates the average of a list of numbers and includes error handling:

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = 0
    count = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if not isinstance(num, (int, float)):
            raise ValueError("Non-numeric value found in input list")
        total += num
        count += 1

    if count == 0:
        raise ValueError("Input list is empty")

    return total / count

# Example usage
try:
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    average = calculate_average(numbers)
    print(f"The average is: {average}")
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)
```

This function calculates the average of the input list by iterating over each element, checking if it is a numeric value, then summing up the total and counting the number of elements. If the input list is empty or contains non-numeric values, it raises a `ValueError` with an appropriate message.
