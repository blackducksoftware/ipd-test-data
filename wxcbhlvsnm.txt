Sure! Here is a Python program based on the prompt you provided:

```python
# Read a list of integers from user input
numbers = list(map(int, input("Enter a list of integers separated by spaces: ").split()))

# Calculate the sum of all numbers in the list
sum_numbers = sum(numbers)

# Find the maximum and minimum numbers in the list
max_number = max(numbers)
min_number = min(numbers)

# Print the sum, maximum, and minimum numbers
print(f"Sum of all numbers: {sum_numbers}")
print(f"Maximum number: {max_number}")
print(f"Minimum number: {min_number}")
```

This program will prompt the user to enter a list of integers separated by spaces, calculate the sum of all the numbers in the list, and then print the sum along with the maximum and minimum numbers in the list. Feel free to run this program and make modifications as needed!
