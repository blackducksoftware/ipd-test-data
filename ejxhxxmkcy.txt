Sure! Here's a sample program in Python that calculates the factorial of a given number:

```python
def factorial(num):
    if num == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return num * factorial(num - 1)

num = int(input("Enter a number to calculate its factorial: "))
print("The factorial of", num, "is:", factorial(num))
```

You can run this program by entering a number when prompted, and it will calculate and print the factorial of that number.
