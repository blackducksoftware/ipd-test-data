Here is the explanation of the code:

1. Define a function called `sum_of_even_numbers` that takes a list `lst` as input.
2. Initialize a variable `total` to keep track of the sum of even numbers.
3. Iterate through each number `num` in the list `lst`.
4. Check if the number `num` is even by taking the modulus (`%`) of `num` with 2. If the remainder is 0, then the number is even.
5. If the number is even, add it to the `total` sum.
6. After going through all numbers in the list, return the total sum of even numbers.
7. Test the function by creating a list of numbers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.
8. Call the `sum_of_even_numbers` function with the list of numbers as input and print the result.

When you run this code, it will output the sum of all even numbers in the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, which is 30.
