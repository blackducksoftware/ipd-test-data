Here is the code generated by LLM for a simple chatbot that responds to basic greetings and questions in Python:

```python
import random

def greet():
    responses = ["Hello! What can I do for you?", "Hi there! How may I assist you?", "Greetings! How can I help you today?"]
    return random.choice(responses)

def respond(user_input):
    if "hello" in user_input.lower() or "hi" in user_input.lower():
        return "Hello! How are you doing today?"
    elif "how are you" in user_input.lower():
        return "I'm just a chatbot, here to assist you. How can I help you today?"
    elif "thank you" in user_input.lower():
        return "You're welcome! Is there anything else you need help with?"
    else:
        return "I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. Can you please rephrase your question?"

def main():
    print(greet())
    
    while True:
        user_input = input("You: ")
        if user_input.lower() == "exit":
            break
        response = respond(user_input)
        print("Bot:", response)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code is similar to the provided example, with slight modifications to the greetings and responses for the chatbot. It includes a `greet()` function to display random greeting messages, a `respond()` function to handle different user inputs, and a `main()` function to run the chatbot interaction loop.
