Here's a Python function that accomplishes this:

```python
def sum_of_even_numbers(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            total += num
    return total

# Test the function
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
print(sum_of_even_numbers(numbers))  # Output: 20 (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20)
```

This function iterates through each number in the list and checks if the number is even by using the modulus operator (%) to check if it is divisible by 2. If the number is even, it adds that number to the running total. Finally, the function returns the total sum of all even numbers in the list.
