Certainly! Here is a Python program that takes in a list of numbers and returns the average of those numbers:

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = sum(numbers)
    average = total / len(numbers)
    return average

numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
average = calculate_average(numbers)
print("The average of the numbers is:", average)
```

You can input any list of numbers by changing the `numbers` list in the program, and it will calculate and output the average of those numbers.
