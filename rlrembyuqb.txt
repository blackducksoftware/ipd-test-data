Sure, here is the Python code that accomplishes the task:

```python
from collections import Counter
import math

# Function to calculate mean of numbers
def calculate_mean(numbers):
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

# Function to calculate median of numbers
def calculate_median(numbers):
    numbers.sort()
    n = len(numbers)
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return (numbers[n//2 - 1] + numbers[n//2]) / 2
    else:
        return numbers[n//2]

# Function to calculate mode of numbers
def calculate_mode(numbers):
    mode_dict = Counter(numbers)
    mode = [k for k, v in mode_dict.items() if v == max(mode_dict.values())]
    return mode

# Function to calculate variance of numbers
def calculate_variance(numbers):
    mean = calculate_mean(numbers)
    variance = sum([(x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers]) / len(numbers)
    return variance

# Function to calculate standard deviation of numbers
def calculate_standard_deviation(numbers):
    variance = calculate_variance(numbers)
    return math.sqrt(variance)

# Main function
def main():
    numbers = list(map(int, input("Enter numbers separated by space: ").split()))

    mean = calculate_mean(numbers)
    median = calculate_median(numbers)
    mode = calculate_mode(numbers)
    variance = calculate_variance(numbers)
    standard_deviation = calculate_standard_deviation(numbers)

    print(f"Mean: {mean}")
    print(f"Median: {median}")
    print(f"Mode: {mode}")
    print(f"Variance: {variance}")
    print(f"Standard Deviation: {standard_deviation}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

You can copy and paste this code into a Python environment to run it. It will ask you to enter a list of numbers separated by spaces and then calculate the mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation of the numbers.
