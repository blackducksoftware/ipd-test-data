Here is a simple Python program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a user-specified number:

```python
def fibonacci_sequence(n):
    sequence = [0, 1]
    while sequence[-1] + sequence[-2] <= n:
        sequence.append(sequence[-1] + sequence[-2])
    return sequence

# Get user input
num = int(input("Enter a number to generate Fibonacci sequence up to: "))

# Generate Fibonacci sequence
fib_sequence = fibonacci_sequence(num)

# Print the generated sequence
print("Fibonacci sequence up to", num, ":")
print(fib_sequence)
```

You can run this program in any Python IDE or online compiler by copying and pasting the code. It will prompt the user to enter a number and then generate the Fibonacci sequence up to that number.
