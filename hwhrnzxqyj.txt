Sure! Here is a Python program that generates a Fibonacci sequence with 20 numbers:

```python
def fibonacci_sequence(n):
    sequence = [0, 1]
    while len(sequence) < n:
        sequence.append(sequence[-1] + sequence[-2])
    return sequence

fibonacci_20 = fibonacci_sequence(20)
print(fibonacci_20)
```

When you run this program, it will generate a Fibonacci sequence with 20 numbers and print it out.
