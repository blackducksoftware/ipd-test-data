Sure! Here is a prompt you can ask LLM for generating 20+ lines of code in Python:

"Write a Python program that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the input list, squared. The program should also print out the sum of all the squared even numbers in the new list."

This prompt should generate a Python program that filters out the even numbers from the input list, squares them, and then calculates the sum of all the squared even numbers in the new list.
