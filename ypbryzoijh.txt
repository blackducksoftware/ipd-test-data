Here is the Python code for the prompt:

```python
def sum_of_odd_numbers(numbers):
    odd_sum = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 != 0:
            odd_sum += num
    return odd_sum

input_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5]
result = sum_of_odd_numbers(input_list)
print("Sum of odd numbers in the list:", result)
```

This code defines a function `sum_of_odd_numbers` that takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the sum of all the odd numbers in the list. It iterates through each number in the list and adds it to the `odd_sum` if it is an odd number. Finally, it prints the sum of odd numbers in the input list.
