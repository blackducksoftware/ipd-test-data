Below is a simple Python program that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list:

```python
def sum_even_numbers(numbers):
    sum_even = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:  # Check if the number is even
            sum_even += num
    return sum_even

# Take input from the user
numbers = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ")
numbers = list(map(int, numbers.split()))

# Call the function and print the sum of even numbers
print("The sum of even numbers in the list is:", sum_even_numbers(numbers))
```

You can run this program in a Python environment and input a list of numbers separated by spaces. The program will then calculate and print the sum of all the even numbers in the list.
