Sure! Here is a prompt you can ask LLM for generating 20+ lines of code in Python:

"Create a Python program that takes a list of integers as input and calculates the average of all the numbers in the list. Then, remove any numbers that are below the average and print the updated list."

Feel free to adjust the prompt as needed!
