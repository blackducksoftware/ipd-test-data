Sure! Here is a Python program that takes a list of numbers as input and outputs the sum of all the even numbers in the list:

```python
def sum_even_numbers(numbers):
    try:
        total = 0
        for num in numbers:
            if num % 2 == 0:
                total += num
        return total
    except TypeError:
        return "Invalid input! Please provide a list of numbers."

# Test the function with some sample inputs
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print(sum_even_numbers(numbers))

numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
print(sum_even_numbers(numbers))

numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
print(sum_even_numbers(numbers))

invalid_input = "invalid input"
print(sum_even_numbers(invalid_input))
```

This program defines a function `sum_even_numbers` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list. It includes error handling to check for invalid inputs.
