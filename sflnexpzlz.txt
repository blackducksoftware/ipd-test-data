Sure thing! Here is an example code in Python that takes in a list of integers and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list:

```python
def sum_even_numbers(nums):
    # Initialize sum to 0
    total_sum = 0
    
    try:
        for num in nums:
            # Check if the number is even
            if num % 2 == 0:
                # Add the even number to the total sum
                total_sum += num
    except TypeError:
        # Handle invalid inputs (e.g. if nums is not a list)
        print("Invalid input. Please provide a list of integers.")
    
    return total_sum

# Test the function with sample input
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print(sum_even_numbers(numbers)) # Output should be 12
```

In this code:
1. We define a function called `sum_even_numbers` that takes a list of integers as input.
2. We initialize a variable `total_sum` to keep track of the sum of even numbers.
3. We iterate through the input list `nums` and check if each number is even by using the modulo operator `%`.
4. If the number is even, we add it to the `total_sum`.
5. We use a `try-except` block to handle potential `TypeError`s that could occur if the input is not a list.
6. Finally, we return the `total_sum` after processing all the numbers in the list.

You can run this code in a Python environment to see the sum of even numbers in the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
