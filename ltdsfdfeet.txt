Sure! Here is a Python program that does exactly that:

```python
import random
from statistics import mean, median, mode

# Generate random list of 100 numbers between 1 and 1000
random_list = [random.randint(1, 1000) for _ in range(100)]

# Sort the list in ascending order
random_list.sort()

# Calculate the mean, median, and mode of the list
mean_value = mean(random_list)
median_value = median(random_list)
mode_value = mode(random_list)

print("Random List:", random_list)
print("Mean:", mean_value)
print("Median:", median_value)
print("Mode:", mode_value)
```

You can run this program in a Python environment to generate a random list of 100 numbers, sort them in ascending order, and then calculate the mean, median, and mode of the list.
