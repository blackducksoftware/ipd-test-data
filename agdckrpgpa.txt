Sure, here is a simple Python program that takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the average of those numbers:

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = sum(numbers)
    average = total / len(numbers)
    return average

if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = [int(x) for x in input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ").split()]
    average = calculate_average(numbers)
    print(f"The average of the numbers is: {average}")
```

You can run this program and provide a list of numbers separated by spaces as input. The program will then calculate the average of those numbers and output it.
