Here is a Python program that fulfills the prompt:

```python
def calculate_above_average(numbers):
    avg = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    
    above_avg = [num for num in numbers if num > avg]
    
    count_above_avg = len(above_avg)
    
    print(f"The average of the numbers is: {avg}")
    
    print("Numbers above the average:")
    for num in above_avg:
        print(num)
    
    print(f"Total numbers above the average: {count_above_avg}")

# Test the program
numbers = [12, 5, 7, 20, 15, 3, 10]
calculate_above_average(numbers)
```

You can run this program by copying and pasting it into a Python environment or a text editor that supports Python, save the file with a `.py` extension, and then run it. The program will take the list of numbers provided in the `numbers` variable, calculate the average of those numbers, and print out all the numbers that are above the average, along with the count of numbers that are above the average.
