Here is a Python program that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    elif n < 0:
        return "Factorial is not defined for negative numbers."
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

try:
    num = int(input("Enter a non-negative integer to calculate its factorial: "))
    result = factorial(num)
    print(f"The factorial of {num} is: {result}")
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a non-negative integer.")
```

This program defines a recursive function `factorial` that calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer. It handles edge cases such as negative numbers and non-integers input by providing appropriate error messages. You can run this program in a Python environment to calculate the factorial of any non-negative integer input by the user. Let me know if you would like any modifications or further explanation.
