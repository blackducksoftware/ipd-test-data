```python
# Function to calculate the average temperature
def average_temp(temps):
    total = sum(temps)
    num_temps = len(temps)
    average = total / num_temps
    return average

# Get the list of temperatures from the user
temps = input("Enter the list of temperatures separated by commas: ")

# Convert the input string into a list of floats
temps_list = [float(temp) for temp in temps.split(',')]

# Calculate the average temperature
avg_temp = average_temp(temps_list)

print(f"The average temperature is: {avg_temp}")
```

This program prompts the user to enter a list of temperatures separated by commas, then calculates the average temperature of those temperatures and prints the result.
