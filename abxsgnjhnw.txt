Sure! Here is a prompt you can ask LLM:

"Generate a program in Python that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a certain number input by the user. The program should prompt the user to enter a number, then display all Fibonacci numbers up to that number. Make sure to use a loop to calculate the sequence."

This prompt should generate 20+ lines of code in Python.
