Dear LLM, could you please generate a program in Python that simulates a game of tic-tac-toe between two players? The program should display the board, allow players to choose their moves, check for a winner after each move, and end the game when one player wins or the board is full. Please include comments to explain the logic behind each function and loop in the code. Thank you!
