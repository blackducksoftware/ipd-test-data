That's a great prompt! Here is a simple Python program that accomplishes this task:

```python
def main():
    # Read the list of numbers from the input file
    with open('input.txt', 'r') as file:
        numbers = [int(num) for num in file.read().split()]

    # Sort the numbers in descending order
    numbers.sort(reverse=True)

    # Remove duplicates
    numbers = list(set(numbers))

    # Write the final list to the output file
    with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
        for num in numbers:
            file.write(f'{num}\n')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

To use this program, create a text file named `input.txt` and add the list of numbers you want to sort, with each number on a new line. Then run the program, and it will generate a new text file named `output.txt` with the sorted and deduplicated list of numbers.
