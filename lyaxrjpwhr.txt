Sure! Here is a prompt you can ask Language Model for developing a code in Python:

"Write a Python program that takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the sum of all even numbers in the list. Output the total sum as the result."

You can adjust the prompt as needed to generate more than 20 lines of code.
