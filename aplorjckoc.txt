Here's a Python program that does what you described:

```python
def remove_duplicates_and_calculate_average(nums):
    # Sort the list in ascending order
    sorted_nums = sorted(nums)
    
    # Remove duplicates by converting the sorted list to a set and back to a list
    unique_nums = list(set(sorted_nums))
    
    # Calculate the average of the remaining numbers
    average = sum(unique_nums) / len(unique_nums)
    
    return average

# Test the program
nums = [4, 2, 1, 3, 2, 4, 5]
average = remove_duplicates_and_calculate_average(nums)
print("Average of the unique numbers:", average)
```

When you run this program with the input `[4, 2, 1, 3, 2, 4, 5]`, it will output `Average of the unique numbers: 3.0`.
