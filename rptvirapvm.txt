Here is a Python program that generates the first 20 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[i-1] + fib_sequence[i-2])
    return fib_sequence

fibonacci_sequence = fibonacci(20)
print(fibonacci_sequence)
```

This program defines a function `fibonacci` that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the `n`th term. It then calls this function to generate the first 20 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence and prints them to the console.
