Sure! Here is the solution in Python:

```python
def filter_even_numbers(input_list):
    even_numbers = [num for num in input_list if num % 2 == 0]
    even_numbers.sort(reverse=True)
    return even_numbers

input_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
result = filter_even_numbers(input_list)
print(result)
```

If you need a solution in another programming language, please let me know which language you prefer!
