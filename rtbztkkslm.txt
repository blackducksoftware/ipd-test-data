Prompt: Write a program in Python that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list.

LLM code:
```
def sum_even_numbers(numbers):
    even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
    sum_even = sum(even_numbers)
    return sum_even
    
# Test the function
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
result = sum_even_numbers(numbers)
print(result)
```
