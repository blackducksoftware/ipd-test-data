```python
# Function to filter even numbers from a list
def filter_even_numbers(input_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store even numbers
    even_numbers = []
    
    # Iterate through the input list
    for num in input_list:
        # Check if the number is even
        if num % 2 == 0:
            # Add the even number to the new list
            even_numbers.append(num)
    
    # Return the list of even numbers
    return even_numbers

# Input list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Call the function to filter even numbers
even_numbers_list = filter_even_numbers(numbers)

# Print the list of even numbers
print("List of even numbers:", even_numbers_list)
```

When you run this program with the input list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, it will create a new list that contains only the even numbers `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]` and print it out. Feel free to test it with different input lists!
