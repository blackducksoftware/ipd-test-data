Here is a Python program that takes a list of numbers as input and outputs the sum of all the even numbers in the list:

```python
def sum_even_numbers(numbers):
    sum_even = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            sum_even += num
    return sum_even

# Input list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# Calculate sum of even numbers in the list
result = sum_even_numbers(numbers)

# Output the result
print("Sum of even numbers in the list:", result)
```

You can test this program with different input lists to see how it handles cases where the input list is empty or does not contain any even numbers. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!
