```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    # Get the length of the array
    n = len(arr)
    
    # Loop through the entire array
    for i in range(n):
        # Flag to check if any swaps are made in this pass
        swapped = False
        
        # Loop through the array up to n-i-1 because the last i elements are already sorted
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            # Compare adjacent elements and swap them if they are in the wrong order
            if arr[j] < arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
                swapped = True
        
        # If no swaps are made in this pass, then the array is already sorted
        if not swapped:
            break
    
    return arr

# Take user input for the list of numbers
nums = input("Enter the list of numbers separated by spaces: ")
nums = list(map(int, nums.split()))

# Sort the list in descending order using bubble sort
sorted_nums = bubble_sort(nums)

# Print the sorted list
print("The sorted list in descending order is:", sorted_nums)
```

This program takes a list of numbers as input from the user, sorts them in descending order using the bubble sort algorithm, and prints the sorted list. The bubble sort algorithm works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order until the entire list is sorted.
