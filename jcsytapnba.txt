Sure! Here's a prompt you can ask LLM for generating 20+ lines of code in Python:

"Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and outputs the sum of all even numbers in the list."

You can also customize this prompt by specifying the particular programming language you would like the code to be written in. Let me know if you need any more assistance!
