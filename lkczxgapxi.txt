Sure! Here is the code generated based on your prompt:

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    try:
        total = sum(numbers)
        average = total / len(numbers)
        return average
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        return "Input list is empty"
    except TypeError:
        return "Invalid input. Please provide a list of numbers."

# Example input
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(calculate_average(numbers))
```

You can adjust the `numbers` list to any list of numbers you want to calculate the average for. Let me know if you need any further modifications or assistance!
