Here's a Python program that calculates the factorial of a number input by the user:

```python
def calculate_factorial(num):
    factorial = 1
    for i in range(1, num + 1):
        factorial *= i
    return factorial

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
result = calculate_factorial(num)
print(f"The factorial of {num} is {result}")
```

You can run this program in your Python interpreter and enter a number to calculate its factorial.
