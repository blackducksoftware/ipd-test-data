Sure! Here's a prompt you can use:

"Write a program in Python that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a user-specified number of terms and prints the result. Bonus points if you can include error handling for invalid inputs."

Feel free to adjust the prompt as needed for your specific requirements.
