Prompt: Write a program that simulates a simple game of rock-paper-scissors. The program should allow the user to input their choice (rock, paper, or scissors), generate a random choice for the computer, compare the two choices, and determine the winner. The program should continue to play rounds until the user decides to quit. The program should also keep track of the number of wins, losses, and ties for the user.
