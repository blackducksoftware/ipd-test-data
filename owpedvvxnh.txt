```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = sum(numbers)
    average = total / len(numbers)
    return average

def main():
    numbers = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ").split()
    numbers = [int(num) for num in numbers]
    
    avg = calculate_average(numbers)
    print(f"The average of the numbers is: {avg}\n")
    
    for num in numbers:
        if num > avg:
            print(f"{num} is above the average")
        elif num < avg:
            print(f"{num} is below the average")
        else:
            print(f"{num} is equal to the average")
            
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
You can run this program by entering a list of numbers separated by spaces. It will then calculate the average of those numbers and print out each number along with a message stating whether it is above, below, or equal to the average.
