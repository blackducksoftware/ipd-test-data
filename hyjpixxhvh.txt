Sure! Here's a simple program that calculates the average of a list of numbers in Python:

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = sum(numbers)
    average = total / len(numbers)
    return average

# Example list of numbers
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

average = calculate_average(numbers)
print("The average of the list of numbers is:", average)
```

You can customize the `numbers` list with your own set of numbers to calculate the average.
