Sure! Here is a Python function that fulfills the requirements:

```python
def sum_even_numbers(numbers):
    # Initialize a variable to store the sum of even numbers
    even_sum = 0
    
    # Loop through each number in the list
    for num in numbers:
        # Check if the number is even
        if num % 2 == 0:
            # Add the even number to the sum
            even_sum += num
    
    # Return the sum of even numbers
    return even_sum

# Test with some sample inputs
print(sum_even_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Output should be 6 (2 + 4)
print(sum_even_numbers([1, 3, 5]))         # Output should be 0 (No even numbers)
print(sum_even_numbers([]))                # Output should be 0 (Empty list)
```

This function is designed to efficiently iterate through the list of numbers and add up only the even numbers. It includes comments to explain the purpose of each part of the code, making it easier to understand. Additionally, it handles edge cases such as an empty list or a list with only odd numbers.
