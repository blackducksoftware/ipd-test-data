Here is a sample code for the Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python:

```python
import random

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return "It's a tie!"
    elif (user_choice == "rock" and computer_choice == "scissors") or (user_choice == "paper" and computer_choice == "rock") or (user_choice == "scissors" and computer_choice == "paper"):
        return "You win!"
    else:
        return "Computer wins!"

def play_game():
    choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
    
    while True:
        user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors) or type 'quit' to exit: ")
        if user_choice == "quit":
            break
        elif user_choice not in choices:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
            continue
        
        computer_choice = random.choice(choices)
        
        print(f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}")
        print(determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))
        
play_game()
```

You can copy and paste this code into a Python environment and run the program to play the Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The program will continue to ask the user to play again until they type 'quit' to exit. Enjoy the game!
