```python

    # Remove punctuation
    sentence = ''.join([char for char in sentence if char.isalnum() or char.isspace()])

    # Convert to lowercase and split into words
    words = sentence.lower().split()

    # Create a dictionary to store word frequencies
    word_freq = {}
    for word in words:
        if word in word_freq:
            word_freq[word] += 1
        else:
            word_freq[word] = 1

    # Sort the unique words in alphabetical order
    unique_words = sorted(list(word_freq.keys()))

    # Display the unique words with their frequencies
    for word in unique_words:

```
This program takes a sentence as input, removes punctuation, converts all words to lowercase, and then displays the unique words in alphabetical order along with their frequencies. You can test the program by running it with a sample sentence.
