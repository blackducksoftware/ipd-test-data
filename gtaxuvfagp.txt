Prompt: Write a program in Python that prompts the user to enter a list of numbers, then outputs the sum of all the numbers entered.

LKM's generated code could be:

```
# Prompt user to enter a list of numbers
numbers = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ").split()

# Initialize a variable to hold the sum of the numbers
sum_numbers = 0

# Iterate through the list of numbers and calculate the sum
for num in numbers:
    sum_numbers += int(num)

# Output the sum of the numbers
print("The sum of the numbers is:", sum_numbers)
```

This code will prompt the user to enter a list of numbers, split the input into individual numbers, calculate the sum of all the numbers, and finally output the sum to the user.
