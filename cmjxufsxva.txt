Here is a program in Python that accomplishes the task you described:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Read in a list of numbers
numbers = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ")
numbers = [float(num) for num in numbers.split()]

# Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the numbers
mean = np.mean(numbers)
std_dev = np.std(numbers)

# Output the results
print(f"Mean: {mean}")
print(f"Standard Deviation: {std_dev}")

# Create a histogram showing the distribution of the numbers
plt.hist(numbers, bins=10, edgecolor='black')
plt.xlabel('Numbers')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.title('Histogram of Numbers')
plt.show()
```

You can run this program in a Python environment, input a list of numbers when prompted, and it will calculate the mean and standard deviation of the numbers while also displaying a histogram showing the distribution.
