Sure! Here is a sample program in Python that does just that:

```python
def sum_even_numbers(numbers):
    sum_even = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            sum_even += num
    return sum_even

# Get input from user
numbers = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ").split()
numbers = [int(num) for num in numbers]

# Call the function with the input list and print the result
result = sum_even_numbers(numbers)
print("Sum of even numbers in the list:", result)
```

You can run this program in a Python interpreter and provide a list of numbers separated by spaces as input. The program will then calculate and print the sum of all the even numbers in the list.
