Here is a Python program generated by LLM for the prompt:

```python
def sum_even_numbers(numbers):
    even_sum = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            even_sum += num
    return even_sum

# Test the program with some input
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print(f"The sum of even numbers in the list is: {sum_even_numbers(numbers)}")
```

This program defines a function `sum_even_numbers` that takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the sum of all even numbers in the list. It then applies this function to a sample list of numbers and prints the result. You can modify the `numbers` list with different values to test the program with different inputs.
