Sure! Here is an example program in Python that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms and prints the result:

```python
def fibonacci_sequence(num_terms):
    fibonacci_series = []
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(num_terms):
        fibonacci_series.append(a)
        a, b = b, a + b
    return fibonacci_series

num_terms = int(input("Enter the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence: "))
fibonacci_series = fibonacci_sequence(num_terms)

print("Fibonacci sequence up to", num_terms, "terms:", fibonacci_series)
```

You can run this program in a Python environment by copying and pasting the code into a Python file and executing it. The program will ask you to enter the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence and then it will print the result.
