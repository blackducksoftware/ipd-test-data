Here is a sample code generated by LLM for this program:

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = sum(numbers)
    average = total / len(numbers)
    return average

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
avg = calculate_average(numbers)
print("The average of the numbers is:", avg)
```

You can customize the `numbers` list with your own set of numbers. Just copy and paste this code into your preferred IDE or text editor and run it to see the average of the numbers.
