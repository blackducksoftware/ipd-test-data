Sure! Here is a Python program that accomplishes this:

```python
def sum_numbers(numbers):
    total = sum(numbers)
    return total

def average_numbers(numbers):
    avg = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    return avg

# Input list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] # Can be integers or floating-point numbers

# Calculate sum of numbers
total_sum = sum_numbers(numbers)
print("Sum of numbers:", total_sum)

# Calculate average of numbers
avg_num = average_numbers(numbers)
print("Average of numbers:", avg_num)
```

You can run this program by providing a list of numbers as input and it will calculate the sum and average of the numbers in the list. Feel free to modify the `numbers` list to test different inputs. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!
