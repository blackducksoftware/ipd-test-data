Here is your Python program that implements the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort a list of numbers in ascending order:

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    
    return arr

# Input list containing at least 10 numbers
input_list = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90, 45, 67, 89]

print("Input list:", input_list)
sorted_list = bubble_sort(input_list)
print("Sorted list:", sorted_list)
```

This program defines a `bubble_sort` function that implements the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort a list of numbers in place. The input list provided contains at least 10 numbers, and the program outputs the sorted list in ascending order.

Feel free to run this program in your Python environment to see the sorted list output!
