Overall, the code looks good and effectively fulfills the given prompt. 

One improvement could be to specify the exception type that the program is catching in the try-except block, rather than using a general `except` clause. This can help in handling specific errors and provide more accurate error messages.

Additionally, it would be beneficial to add comments to explain the purpose of each part of the code, making it more readable and easier to understand for other programmers. 

Other than that, the program is well-written and achieves the desired functionality. Well done!
