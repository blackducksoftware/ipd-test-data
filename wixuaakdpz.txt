Here's a Python program that does exactly that:

```python
def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def sum_of_primes(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if is_prime(num):
            total += num
    return total

# Example input list of numbers
input_list = [2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 13, 15]

# Calculate sum of prime numbers in the input list
result = sum_of_primes(input_list)

print(f"The sum of all prime numbers in the list is: {result}")
```

You can run this program and provide your own list of numbers as input. It will then calculate and output the sum of all prime numbers in the list.
