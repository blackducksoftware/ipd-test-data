Here is a Python program to implement the Fibonacci sequence up to a user-specified number of terms:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]  # Initialize the sequence with the first two terms

    for i in range(2, n):
        next_term = fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2]
        fib_sequence.append(next_term)

    return fib_sequence

def main():
    n = int(input("Enter the number of Fibonacci terms you would like to see: "))
    
    if n <= 0:
        print("Number of terms should be a positive integer. Exiting program.")
        return

    fibonacci_seq = fibonacci(n)
    
    print("Fibonacci Sequence:")
    print(fibonacci_seq)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

You can run this program in your Python environment and input the number of Fibonacci terms you would like to see. The program will display the Fibonacci sequence up to that number of terms.
