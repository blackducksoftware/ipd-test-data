Here is the Python program as per the prompt:

```python
def sum_of_odd_numbers(numbers):
    # Initialize sum to 0
    odd_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate through each number in the list
    for num in numbers:
        # Check if the number is odd
        if num % 2 != 0:
            # Add odd number to the sum
            odd_sum += num
            
    # Return the sum of odd numbers
    return odd_sum

# Test cases
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
list2 = [2, 4, 6, 8]
list3 = []

# Sum of odd numbers in list1
print(sum_of_odd_numbers(list1))  # Output should be 9

# Sum of odd numbers in list2
print(sum_of_odd_numbers(list2))  # Output should be 0

# Handling empty list
print(sum_of_odd_numbers(list3))  # Output should be 0
```

The program defines a function `sum_of_odd_numbers` that calculates the sum of all odd numbers in a given list. It iterates through the list and checks if each number is odd by using the modulo operator. If a number is odd, it adds it to the running sum `odd_sum`. Finally, the function returns the total sum of odd numbers.

Test cases are included to demonstrate the functionality of the program, including handling cases where the input list is empty or does not contain any odd numbers.
