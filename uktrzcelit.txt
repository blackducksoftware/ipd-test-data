Here is a sample program in Python that accomplishes this task:

```python
def calculate_factorial(num):
    factorial = 1
    for i in range(1, num + 1):
        factorial *= i
    return factorial

while True:
    try:
        user_input = int(input("Please enter a number to calculate its factorial: "))
        if user_input < 0:
            print("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers. Please enter a non-negative number.")
        else:
            result = calculate_factorial(user_input)
            print(f"The factorial of {user_input} is: {result}")
            break
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")
```

You can run this program in a Python interpreter or a Python IDE, and it will prompt the user to enter a number. It will then calculate the factorial of that number using a loop and display the result. The program also includes error handling to handle invalid input, such as non-integer values.
