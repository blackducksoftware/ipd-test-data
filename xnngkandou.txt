Here is a Python program that accomplishes this task:

```python
def filter_even_numbers(numbers):
    even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
    even_numbers.sort(reverse=True)
    return even_numbers

# Input list of numbers
numbers = [12, 7, 14, 9, 20, 16, 3]

# Filter even numbers and sort in descending order
result = filter_even_numbers(numbers)

# Output the result
print(result)
```

When you run this program with the input list `[12, 7, 14, 9, 20, 16, 3]`, it will output `[20, 16, 14, 12]`, which are the even numbers in the input list sorted in descending order.
