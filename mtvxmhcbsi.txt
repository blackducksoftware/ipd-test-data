Sure, here is a Python program that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a certain number:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    while fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2] <= n:
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])
    return fib_sequence

n = int(input("Enter a number to calculate Fibonacci sequence up to: "))
result = fibonacci(n)
print("Fibonacci sequence up to", n, "is:", result)
```

You can copy and paste this code into a Python editor or run it in a Python environment to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to a certain number. Just enter the number when prompted and the program will generate the Fibonacci sequence up to that number.
