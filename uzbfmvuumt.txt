Sure! Here is an example of how you can implement this program in Python:

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    try:
        if not numbers:
            raise ValueError("Input list is empty")
        
        total = 0
        count = 0
        
        for num in numbers:
            if not isinstance(num, (int, float)):
                raise ValueError("Non-numeric input found")
            total += num
            count += 1
        
        avg = total / count
        return avg
        
    except ValueError as e:
        return str(e)

# Test the function with a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(calculate_average(numbers))
```

You can run this code in a Python environment and provide a list of numbers to test it out. Let me know if you need the code in another language.
