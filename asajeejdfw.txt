Sure, here is a prompt you can ask LLM:

"Write a program in Python that takes an input number from the user and then prints out the Fibonacci sequence up to that number. Make sure to include error handling for invalid inputs and utilize recursion to calculate the Fibonacci sequence."

This should generate at least 20 lines of Python code from LLM.
