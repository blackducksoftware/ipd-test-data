Here's a Python program that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a user-specified number of terms:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[i-1] + fib_sequence[i-2])
    return fib_sequence[:n]

# Get user input
terms = int(input("Enter the number of Fibonacci terms: "))

# Calculate Fibonacci sequence
fib_terms = fibonacci(terms)

# Display the Fibonacci sequence
print(f"Fibonacci sequence up to {terms} terms:")
for term in fib_terms:
    print(term)
```

You can run this program in a Python interpreter and enter the number of Fibonacci terms you want to calculate. The program will then display the Fibonacci sequence up to that number of terms.
