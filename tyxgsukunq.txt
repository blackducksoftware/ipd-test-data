Sure! Here's a prompt you can use to generate 20+ lines of code in Python:

"Generate a Python program that reads a list of numbers from the user, calculates the sum, average, maximum, and minimum of the numbers, and then prints out the results."

You can ask LLM to generate code based on this prompt.
