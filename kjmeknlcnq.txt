Sure! Here's a programming prompt you can ask LLM:

Write a program in Python that takes a list of numbers as input and outputs a new list with only the even numbers from the input list. The program should use list comprehension to achieve this.

After providing this prompt to LLM, you can expect to receive 20+ lines of Python code that accomplishes the task described.
