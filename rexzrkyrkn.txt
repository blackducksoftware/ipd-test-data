Prompt: Write a program in Python that takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the average of all the numbers in the list. Make sure to include error handling for cases where the input is not a list or if the list is empty. 

LLM-generated code:

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    try:
        total = 0
        count = 0
        for num in numbers:
            total += num
            count += 1
        average = total / count
        return average
    except TypeError:
        print("Error: Input must be a list of numbers")
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Error: List cannot be empty")

# Test the function
numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20]
print("Average:", calculate_average(numbers))

numbers = []
print("Average:", calculate_average(numbers))

numbers = "invalid input"
print("Average:", calculate_average(numbers))
``` 

This code includes error handling for both the cases where the input is not a list of numbers or if the list is empty, ensuring the program runs smoothly in any scenario.
