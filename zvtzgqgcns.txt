Here is the Python code for a program that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

try:
    num = int(input("Enter a number to calculate its factorial: "))
    if num < 0:
        print("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.")
    else:
        result = factorial(num)
        print(f"The factorial of {num} is {result}")
except ValueError:
    print("Please enter a valid integer.")
```

This program prompts the user to enter a number, calculates its factorial using recursion, and then outputs the result. Error handling is implemented to handle non-integer inputs.
