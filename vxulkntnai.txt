Sure! Here's a prompt you can ask LLM:

"Create a program that takes user input for a list of numbers, checks if each number is prime or composite, and then prints out the result for each number. Make sure to handle any errors or invalid input."

This prompt should generate more than 20 lines of code in a popular programming language like Python, Java, or C++.
