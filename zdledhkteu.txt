The Python code uses a function `sum_of_even_numbers` to calculate the sum of even numbers, while the Java code uses a static method `sumOfEvenNumbers` in a class called `SumOfEvenNumbers`. Both codes iterate through the input list of numbers, check if each number is even using the modulo operator `%`, and add it to the sum if it is even.

After calculating the sum of even numbers, both codes print the result to the console.

You can run either the Python or Java code to get the sum of even numbers in the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
