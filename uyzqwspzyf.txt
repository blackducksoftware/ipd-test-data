Sure! Here's a prompt you can ask LLM:

"Generate a program in Python that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion. The program should take the number as input from the user and output the result. Make sure to include error handling for negative numbers and non-integer inputs."

This prompt should result in LLM generating over 20 lines of code in Python.
