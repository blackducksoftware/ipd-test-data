Prompt: Create a program that simulates a deck of cards and allows users to shuffle, deal, and display the cards. The program should use object-oriented programming principles and should include classes for a Card, Deck, and Player. The Card class should have properties for suit and value. The Deck class should have methods for shuffling and dealing cards. The Player class should have a hand property to store the dealt cards. The program should have a user interface that allows users to interact with the deck and players. Use any popular programming language to implement this program.
