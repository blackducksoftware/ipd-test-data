Sure! Here is a prompt you can ask LLM:

"Can you generate a function in Python that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with only the even numbers squared? The function should be named 'square_even_numbers'."

This prompt should generate at least 20 lines of Python code, depending on the complexity of the function.
