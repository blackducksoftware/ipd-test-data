Prompt: Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and sorts them in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm. 

LLM Response (Python):

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr

# Taking input from the user
numbers = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ").split()
numbers = [int(num) for num in numbers]

sorted_numbers = bubble_sort(numbers)
print("Sorted numbers:", sorted_numbers)
```
