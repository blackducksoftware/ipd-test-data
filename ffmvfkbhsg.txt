Here is a Python program that accomplishes the task:

```python
from collections import Counter

def calculate_mean(numbers):
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

def calculate_median(numbers):
    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
    n = len(sorted_numbers)
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return (sorted_numbers[n//2 - 1] + sorted_numbers[n//2]) / 2
    else:
        return sorted_numbers[n//2]

def calculate_mode(numbers):
    counter = Counter(numbers)
    mode = counter.most_common(1)
    return mode[0][0]

numbers = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ").split()
numbers = [int(num) for num in numbers]

mean = calculate_mean(numbers)
median = calculate_median(numbers)
mode = calculate_mode(numbers)

print("Mean:", mean)
print("Median:", median)
print("Mode:", mode)
```

You can run this program in a Python interpreter or save it as a .py file and run it. It will prompt you to enter a list of numbers separated by spaces, and then it will calculate and display the mean, median, and mode of the list.
