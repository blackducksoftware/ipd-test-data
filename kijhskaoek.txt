Sure! Here is a prompt you can use to ask LLM for generating code in Python:

Prompt: "Can you generate a Python program that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers in the input list? Make sure the program includes error handling for non-numeric inputs."

LLM might generate something like this:

```python
def filter_even_numbers(input_list):
    try:
        even_numbers = [num for num in input_list if num % 2 == 0]
        return even_numbers
    except TypeError:
        print("Error: Non-numeric input found in the list")
        return []

input_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, '5']
result = filter_even_numbers(input_list)
print(result)
```

This code will take a list as input, filter out the even numbers, handle any non-numeric inputs, and return the list of even numbers.
