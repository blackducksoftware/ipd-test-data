Here is a sample solution to the prompt:

```python
def squared_even_numbers(input_list):
    even_squared = [num ** 2 for num in input_list if num % 2 == 0]
    return even_squared

def sum_of_squared_even_numbers(input_list):
    even_squared = squared_even_numbers(input_list)
    return sum(even_squared)

# Input list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Get new list with only even numbers squared
new_list = squared_even_numbers(numbers)
print("New list with only even numbers squared:", new_list)

# Calculate and print sum of squared even numbers in the new list
total_sum = sum_of_squared_even_numbers(numbers)
print("Sum of squared even numbers in the new list:", total_sum)
```

You can run this code in any Python environment by providing a list of numbers as an input. Let me know if you need any modifications or further assistance!
