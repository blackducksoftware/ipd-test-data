Here's a simple implementation in Python:

```python
import random

while True:
    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']
    
    user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors) or type 'quit' to exit: ").lower()
    if user_choice == 'quit':
        print("Thanks for playing!")
        break
    
    if user_choice not in choices:
        print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
        continue
    
    computer_choice = random.choice(choices)
    
    print(f"Computer chooses: {computer_choice}")
    
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        print("It's a tie!")
    elif (user_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'scissors') or (user_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'paper') or (user_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'rock'):
        print("You win!")
    else:
        print("Computer wins!")
    
    print()
```

This program will prompt the user to enter their choice and then simulate a game of rock-paper-scissors against the computer. The game will continue until the user chooses to quit by typing 'quit'. Feel free to modify and customize this code further based on your needs!
