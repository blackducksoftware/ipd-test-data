Sure, here is the code generated by LLM based on your prompt:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if num < 0:
    print("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers")
elif num == 0:
    print("The factorial of 0 is 1")
else:
    result = factorial(num)
    print(f"The factorial of {num} is {result}")
```

This Python program takes a user's input for a number, calculates the factorial of that number using a recursive function called `factorial()`, and then displays the result to the user.
