Certainly! Below is a Python program that accomplishes this:

```python
# Ask user for their name
name = input("What is your name? ")

# Ask user for their age
age = input("How old are you? ")

# Print a message with the user's name and age
print("Hello " + name + ", you are " + age + " years old")
```

When you run this program, it will prompt you to enter your name and age, and then it will print out a message saying "Hello [name], you are [age] years old" with the values provided by the user.
