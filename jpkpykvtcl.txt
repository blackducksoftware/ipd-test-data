Sure, here is a prompt you can use:
"Generate a program in Python that simulates a basic game of rock-paper-scissors. The program should allow the user to input their choice (rock, paper, or scissors) and then randomly generate a choice for the computer. The program should then determine the winner based on the rules of the game (rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock) and display the result to the user. The program should continue to play rounds until the user chooses to quit. Additionally, keep track of the number of wins, losses, and ties for the user throughout the game."
