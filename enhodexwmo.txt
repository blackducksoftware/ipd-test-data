This program allows the user to input the number of dice and sides on each dice, and then simulates a dice roll game where the user can roll the dice multiple times. The program keeps track of the number of rolls and displays the total sum of all the rolls. At the end of the game, the program calculates the average roll result and displays it to the user.
