Here is the Python program that accomplishes the task:

```python
def get_even_sorted_list(numbers):
    even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
    even_numbers.sort()
    return even_numbers

# Input list of numbers
numbers = [10, 5, 8, 3, 12, 7, 14, 6, 9]

# Get the new list with even numbers sorted in ascending order
even_sorted_list = get_even_sorted_list(numbers)

# Print the new list
print(even_sorted_list)
```

When this program is executed with the given input list `[10, 5, 8, 3, 12, 7, 14, 6, 9]`, it will output `[6, 8, 10, 12, 14]`, which are the even numbers sorted in ascending order.
