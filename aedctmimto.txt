Sure! Here is a simple Python program that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of all the numbers in the list:

```python
def sum_of_numbers(numbers):
    total = 0
    for number in numbers:
        total += number
    return total

# Input list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Calculate sum of numbers in the list
result = sum_of_numbers(numbers)

# Print the result
print("The sum of numbers in the list is:", result)
```

You can run this program by copying the code into a Python interpreter or a Python file and providing your own list of numbers as input.
