```python
def fibonacci_sequence(n):
    fib_sequence = []
    a, b = 0, 1
    while a < n:
        fib_sequence.append(a)
        a, b = b, a + b
    return fib_sequence

num = int(input("Enter a number to generate Fibonacci sequence up to: "))
fib_output = fibonacci_sequence(num)
print("Fibonacci sequence up to", num, "is:")
print(fib_output)
```

This program takes a user-provided number as input and generates the Fibonacci sequence up to that number. It then prints out the Fibonacci sequence.
