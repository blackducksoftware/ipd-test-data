This Python program takes a user-specified limit as input and generates a Fibonacci sequence of numbers up to that limit. 

It defines a function `fibonacci_sequence` that takes the limit as a parameter and then initializes the sequence with `[0, 1]`. It then calculates the next number in the sequence by adding the last two numbers and appends it to the sequence until the next number exceeds the limit. 

Finally, it prints the Fibonacci sequence up to the specified limit.
