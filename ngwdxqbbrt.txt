Sure! Here is a prompt you can use:

"Write a program in Python that takes in a list of numbers and returns a new list containing only the even numbers squared. The program should include error handling to check if the input is a list of numbers and handle any invalid inputs accordingly. Additionally, the program should include comments to explain each section of code."
