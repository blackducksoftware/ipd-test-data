Sure! Here is a simple program in Python that calculates Fibonacci numbers:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return "Please enter a positive integer"
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Taking user input
num = int(input("Enter the number of terms: "))

if num <= 0:
    print("Please enter a positive integer")
else:
    print("Fibonacci sequence:")
    for i in range(1, num+1):
        print(fibonacci(i))
```

You can run this program in your Python environment by copying and pasting the code above. Hope this helps!
