Here is the Python program that accomplishes this task:

```python
def sum_even_numbers(lst):
    even_sum = 0
    for num in lst:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            even_sum += num
    return even_sum

input_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
output = sum_even_numbers(input_list)
print(output)
```

This program defines a function `sum_even_numbers` that takes a list as input and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list. It iterates through the list and adds up the even numbers to the `even_sum` variable. Finally, it returns the sum of even numbers.

You can test this program by changing the `input_list` to any list of numbers containing both positive and negative values.
