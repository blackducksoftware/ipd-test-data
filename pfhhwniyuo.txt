Here is a Python program that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a user-specified number using recursion:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

n = int(input("Enter the number of terms you want in the Fibonacci sequence: "))

if n <= 0:
    print("Please enter a positive integer.")
else:
    print("Fibonacci sequence up to", n, "terms:")
    for i in range(n):
        print(fibonacci(i))
```

You can run this program and input the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence you want to calculate, and it will output the sequence up to that number using recursion.
