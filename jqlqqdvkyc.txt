Here is a Python function that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers in the input list:

```python
def filter_even_numbers(input_list):
    even_numbers = [num for num in input_list if num % 2 == 0]
    return even_numbers

# Test the function
input_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
result = filter_even_numbers(input_list)
print(result)
```

In this function, a list comprehension is used to filter out only the even numbers from the input list by checking if each number is divisible by 2 without a remainder. The resulting list of even numbers is then returned.
