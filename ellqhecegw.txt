Here's a Python program that does just that:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
result = factorial(num)

print(f"The factorial of {num} is: {result}")
```

You can copy and paste this code into a Python interpreter or IDE, run it, and then enter a number when prompted. The program will calculate the factorial of the input number and display it as output.
