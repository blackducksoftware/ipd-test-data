Sure, here is a prompt you can ask LLM to generate code for:

Prompt: Write a program in Python that generates a Fibonacci sequence up to a user-specified number of terms. The program should take an input from the user for the number of terms in the sequence and output the Fibonacci sequence up to that number of terms.

This prompt should generate at least 20 lines of code in Python.
