Sure! Here's a prompt you can ask LLM:
"Please generate a program in Python that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. The program should include error handling to check if the input is a list of integers and should print an error message if not. The program should also include comments explaining each step of the process."
