Sure! Here's a prompt you can ask LLM:

"Write a program in Python that generates a list of prime numbers up to a user-specified number. The program should prompt the user to enter a number, and then display all prime numbers up to that number. Make sure to include comments explaining how the program works."

Feel free to adjust the prompt as needed for your specific requirements!
