Here is a sample Python program that fulfills the prompt:

```python
def is_even(num):
    return num % 2 == 0

def sum_even_numbers(numbers):
    even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if is_even(num)]
    sum_even = sum(even_numbers)
    return even_numbers, sum_even

def main():
    numbers = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ").split()
    numbers = [int(num) for num in numbers]

    even_numbers, sum_even = sum_even_numbers(numbers)

    print("Even numbers in the list:", even_numbers)
    print("Sum of even numbers:", sum_even)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

You can run this program in a Python interpreter and test it by entering a list of numbers separated by spaces. It will output the even numbers in the list and their sum.
