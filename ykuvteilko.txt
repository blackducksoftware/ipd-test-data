Here is a Python program that accomplishes the task:

```python
def filter_even_numbers(numbers):
    even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
    even_numbers.sort(reverse=True)
    return even_numbers

# Example list of numbers
numbers = [4, 7, 2, 9, 10, 6, 3, 8]
even_numbers = filter_even_numbers(numbers)

print("Even numbers in the list, sorted in descending order:")
for num in even_numbers:
    print(num)
```

You can input your list of numbers in the `numbers` variable and the program will output the even numbers in descending order.
