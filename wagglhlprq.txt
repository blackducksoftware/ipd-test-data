Here is a sample Python program that fulfills the given prompt:

```python
def calculate_median(numbers):
    numbers.sort(reverse=True)
    n = len(numbers)
    if n % 2 == 0:
        median = (numbers[n//2 - 1] + numbers[n//2]) / 2
    else:
        median = numbers[n//2]
    return median

user_input = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ")
numbers = [int(num) for num in user_input.split()]

median = calculate_median(numbers)
print(f"The sorted list is: {sorted(numbers, reverse=True)}")
print(f"The median of the sorted list is: {median}")
```

You can run this program in a Python environment and input a list of numbers. It will then sort them in descending order and calculate the median of the sorted list. Feel free to modify or expand upon this program as needed!
