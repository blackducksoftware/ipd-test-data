Prompt: Write a program that takes an array as input and returns the sum of all even numbers in the array. 

Expected output: 
- Function should take in an array as input
- Iterate through the array and check if each element is even
- If the element is even, add it to a running total
- Return the final sum of all even numbers in the array

Language: Python 

Code:
```python
def sum_even_numbers(arr):
    total = 0
    for num in arr:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            total += num
    return total

# Test the function
input_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
result = sum_even_numbers(input_array)
print(result)
```
