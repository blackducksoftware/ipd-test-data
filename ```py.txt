In this program, the `get_user_choice` function prompts the user to enter their choice and validates the input. The `get_computer_choice` function generates a random choice for the computer. The `determine_winner` function determines the winner based on the rules of rock-paper-scissors. 

The main part of the program runs in a loop, allowing the user to continue playing until they enter 'q' to quit. The computer's choice is displayed, along with the outcome of the game.
