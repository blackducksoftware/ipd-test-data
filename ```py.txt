```

In this program, the `get_user_choice` function prompts the user to enter their choice and validates the input. The `get_computer_choice` function generates a random choice for the computer. The `determine_winner` function determines the winner based on the rules of rock-paper-scissors. 

The main part of the program runs in a loop, allowing the user to continue playing until they enter 'q' to quit. The computer's choice is displayed, along with the outcome of the game.```python

    sorted_numbers = sorted(unique_numbers, key=int, reverse=True) # Sort in descending order

```

This program simulates a dice game where two players take turns rolling a six-sided die. The game consists of 10 rounds, and after all rounds, the program displays the final scores of each player and determines the winner based on the highest score. Each time a player rolls the die, the program generates a random number between 1 and 6 as the roll result.
