Sure, here is an example program in Python that accomplishes this:

```python
def sum_even_numbers(numbers):
    return sum(num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0)

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
result = sum_even_numbers(numbers)
print(result)
```

This program defines a function `sum_even_numbers` that takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list. It uses a list comprehension to filter out the even numbers and then `sum()` function to calculate the sum. Finally, it calls the function with a sample list of numbers and prints the result.
