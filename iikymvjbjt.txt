Here is a simple Python program that takes user input for a list of numbers, sorts them in descending order using the bubble sort algorithm, and displays the sorted list to the user:

```python
def bubble_sort_descending(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] < arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]

def get_input():
    while True:
        try:
            numbers = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ")
            numbers = [int(num) for num in numbers.split()]
            return numbers
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please try again.")

def main():
    numbers = get_input()
    bubble_sort_descending(numbers)
    print("Sorted list in descending order:", numbers)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

To run this program, copy and paste it into a Python IDE or a text editor and save it as a `.py` file. Then run the program and enter a list of numbers separated by spaces when prompted. The program will sort the numbers in descending order using the bubble sort algorithm and display the sorted list to the user.

Make sure to handle additional error cases and include relevant comments for a more comprehensive program.
