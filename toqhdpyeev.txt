Here is an example of how you can solve this problem in Python:

```python
def fibonacci_sequence(num):
    sequence = []
    a, b = 0, 1
    while a < num:
        sequence.append(a)
        a, b = b, a + b
    return sequence

user_input = int(input("Enter a number to generate a Fibonacci sequence: "))
fib_sequence = fibonacci_sequence(user_input)

print("Fibonacci sequence up to", user_input, ":")
for num in fib_sequence:
    print(num)
```

In this program, we define a function `fibonacci_sequence` that takes a user-specified number and generates the Fibonacci sequence up to that number. We then prompt the user to enter a number, call the `fibonacci_sequence` function with the user input, and print out the Fibonacci sequence up to the specified number.
