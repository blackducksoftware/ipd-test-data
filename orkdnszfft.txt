Certainly! Here is a Python program that takes user input for a list of numbers and calculates the mean, median, and mode:

```python
from statistics import mean, median, mode

# Taking user input for list of numbers
num_list = [int(num) for num in input("Enter the list of numbers separated by space: ").split()]

# Calculating mean
mean_val = mean(num_list)

# Calculating median
median_val = median(num_list)

# Calculating mode
try:
    mode_val = mode(num_list)
except StatisticsError:
    mode_val = "No mode found"

print("Mean:", mean_val)
print("Median:", median_val)
print("Mode:", mode_val)
```

You can run this program in a Python environment and input the list of numbers when prompted. The program will then calculate the mean, median, and mode of the inputted list and display the results.
