Sure! Here is a Python program that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the average of the numbers rounded to the nearest whole number:

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    if len(numbers) == 0:
        return 0
    
    total = sum(numbers)
    average = total / len(numbers)
    
    return round(average)

# Input list of numbers
numbers = [int(x) for x in input("Enter numbers separated by spaces: ").split()]

# Calculate average and print result
print("Average of the numbers: ", calculate_average(numbers))
```

You can run this program in a Python environment and enter a list of numbers separated by spaces. It will then calculate and print the average of the numbers rounded to the nearest whole number.
