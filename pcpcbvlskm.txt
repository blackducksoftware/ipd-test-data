Here is a sample program in Python that takes in a list of names and ages and sorts the list by age in descending order:

```python
# Function to sort list by age in descending order
def sort_by_age(names, ages):
    sorted_list = [(name, age) for name, age in sorted(zip(names, ages), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)]
    return sorted_list

# Main program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Dave']
    ages = [25, 30, 22, 27]

    sorted_list = sort_by_age(names, ages)

    print("Sorted list by age in descending order:")
    for name, age in sorted_list:
        print(f"{name}: {age}")
```

This program defines a function `sort_by_age` that takes in two lists - `names` and `ages`. It then zips the two lists together, sorts the list of tuples by age in descending order using a lambda function, and then returns the sorted list. The main program initializes the lists of names and ages, calls the `sort_by_age` function, and prints the sorted list of names and ages.
