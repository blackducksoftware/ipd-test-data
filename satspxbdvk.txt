Here is a Python program that calculates the average of a list of numbers input by the user, with error handling for non-numeric inputs:

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    if len(numbers) == 0:
        return 0
    total = sum(numbers)
    return total / len(numbers)

def get_numbers_from_input():
    numbers = []
    while True:
        try:
            number = input("Enter a number (press Enter to calculate average): ")
            if not number:
                break
            number = float(number)
            numbers.append(number)
        except ValueError:
            print("Please enter a valid number")

    return numbers

numbers = get_numbers_from_input()
average = calculate_average(numbers)

print(f"The average of the numbers is: {average}")
```

This program first defines a function `calculate_average` to calculate the average of a list of numbers, and a function `get_numbers_from_input` to get numbers input by the user. In the `get_numbers_from_input` function, it continuously prompts the user for input and tries to convert the input to a floating-point number. If the input is not a valid number, it catches the `ValueError` exception and prints an error message. The user can press Enter to stop entering numbers and calculate the average. Finally, the program calculates the average and prints the result.
