Prompt: Write a program in Python that takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the average of the positive numbers in the list. If there are no positive numbers, the program should return 0.

LLM-generated code (Python):

```
def calculate_average_positive_numbers(numbers):
    positive_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num > 0]
    
    if len(positive_numbers) == 0:
        return 0
    
    sum_positive_numbers = sum(positive_numbers)
    average_positive_numbers = sum_positive_numbers / len(positive_numbers)
    
    return average_positive_numbers
    
numbers = [10, -5, 3, -2, 7, -9]

average = calculate_average_positive_numbers(numbers)
print("The average of positive numbers in the list is:", average)
```
