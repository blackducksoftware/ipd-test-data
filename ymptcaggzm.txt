Sure! Here is a simple program that generates a random password with the specified criteria:

```python
import random
import string

def generate_password(length):
    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation
    password = ''
    for _ in range(length):
        password += random.choice(characters)
    return password

while True:
    length = int(input("Enter the length of the password (at least 10 characters): "))
    
    if length < 10:
        print("Password length must be at least 10 characters.")
    else:
        break

password = generate_password(length)
print("Generated Password:", password)
```

This program first imports the necessary modules (`random` and `string`) and defines a function `generate_password` that takes a length parameter. It then generates a random password by randomly selecting characters from uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

The program then prompts the user to enter the desired length of the password (at least 10 characters) and generates the random password accordingly.
