Sure! Here's a simple Python program that calculates the average of a list of numbers:

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = sum(numbers)
    average = total / len(numbers)
    return average

# Example list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Calculate average
avg = calculate_average(numbers)

print("The average of the numbers is:", avg)
```

You can copy and paste this code into a Python interpreter or a Python file and run it to calculate the average of any list of numbers you provide. Just replace the `numbers` list with your own list of numbers.
