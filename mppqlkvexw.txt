Prompt: Write a program that randomly generates a list of 10 integers between 1 and 100, then calculates the average of the list and finds the maximum and minimum values.

Expected output: A program in Python that accomplishes the task described above.

Example code:
```python
import random

# Generate a list of 10 random integers between 1 and 100
random_numbers = [random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(10)]

# Calculate the average of the list
average = sum(random_numbers) / len(random_numbers)

# Find the maximum and minimum values in the list
max_value = max(random_numbers)
min_value = min(random_numbers)

# Print the list, average, maximum and minimum values
print("Random numbers:", random_numbers)
print("Average:", average)
print("Maximum value:", max_value)
print("Minimum value:", min_value)
```
