Here is a program in Python that does this:

```python
def sum_even_numbers(numbers):
    sum_even = 0
    for number in numbers:
        if number % 2 == 0:
            sum_even += number
    return sum_even

# Taking input from the user
numbers = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ")
numbers = list(map(int, numbers.split()))

# Outputting the sum of all even numbers in the list
print("Sum of even numbers in the list: ", sum_even_numbers(numbers))
```

You can run this program in a Python environment and input a list of numbers separated by spaces to get the sum of all the even numbers in that list.
