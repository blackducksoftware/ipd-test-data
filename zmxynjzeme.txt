Sure! Here's a simple Python program that does that:

```python
def sum_of_list(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total

# Input list of numbers
input_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Call the function with the input list
result = sum_of_list(input_list)

print(result)
```

You can replace the `input_list` variable with your own list of numbers to get the sum of those numbers.
