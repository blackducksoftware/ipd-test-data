```python
# Function to calculate average of a list of numbers
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num

    average = total / len(numbers)
    return average

# Get input from user
num_list = []
num_count = int(input("Enter the number of elements in the list: "))

for i in range(num_count):
    num = float(input(f"Enter number {i+1}: "))
    num_list.append(num)

# Call the calculate_average function and print the result
avg = calculate_average(num_list)
print("The average of the list is:", avg)
```

This program first defines a function `calculate_average` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the average of those numbers. It then prompts the user to enter the number of elements in the list and the list of numbers itself. Finally, it calculates the average of the list using the `calculate_average` function and prints the result.
