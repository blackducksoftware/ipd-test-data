Prompt: "Can you write a program that calculates the average of a list of numbers in Python?"

LLM's code:
```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = sum(numbers)
    count = len(numbers)
    average = total / count
    return average

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
result = calculate_average(numbers)
print("The average of the numbers is:", result)
```
