Sure! Here's a prompt you can use to ask LLM to generate 20+ lines of code in Python:

"Generate a Python script that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the average of those numbers. Make sure to include error handling for cases where the input is not a valid list of numbers."

Feel free to modify the prompt as needed for your specific requirements.
