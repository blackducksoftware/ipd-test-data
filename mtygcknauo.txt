Sure! Here is a Python program that does exactly that:

```python
import statistics

def calculate_stats(numbers):
    average = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    median = statistics.median(numbers)
    mode = statistics.mode(numbers)
    
    return average, median, mode

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]  # You can replace this list with any list of numbers you want

average, median, mode = calculate_stats(numbers)

print("Average:", average)
print("Median:", median)
print("Mode:", mode)
```

This program first defines a function called `calculate_stats` that takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the average, median, and mode using the `sum`, `len`, `statistics.median`, and `statistics.mode` functions. 

Then, it creates a list of numbers called `numbers` and calls the `calculate_stats` function with this list. Finally, it prints out the calculated average, median, and mode.

You can replace the `numbers` list with any list of numbers you want to calculate the statistics for. Let me know if you need any further clarification or if you have any specific requirements!
