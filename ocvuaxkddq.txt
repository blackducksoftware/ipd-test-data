```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = sum(numbers)
    average = total / len(numbers)
    return average

def compare_to_threshold(average, threshold):
    if average > threshold:
        return "above"
    elif average < threshold:
        return "below"
    else:
        return "equal to"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = [int(num) for num in input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ").split()]
    threshold = float(input("Enter a threshold value: "))

    average = calculate_average(numbers)
    comparison = compare_to_threshold(average, threshold)

    print(f"The average of the numbers is: {average}")
    print(f"The average is {comparison} the threshold value.")
```
Example Input:
```
Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: 10 20 30 40
Enter a threshold value: 25
```

Example Output:
```
The average of the numbers is: 25.0
The average is equal to the threshold value.
```
