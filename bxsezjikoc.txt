Sure, here is the code in Python that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers multiplied by 2:

```python
def filter_even_numbers(input_list):
    output_list = [num * 2 for num in input_list if num % 2 == 0]
    return output_list

# Example input list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Call the function and print the result
result = filter_even_numbers(numbers)
print(result)
```

You can replace the `numbers` list with any list of numbers you want to test the code with.
