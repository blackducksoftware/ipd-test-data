Sure! Here is a prompt you can use:

"Hey LLM, can you write a program in Python that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list? Additionally, please make sure to handle cases where the input list is empty or contains non-numeric values."

This prompt should generate a program with 20+ lines of code in Python.
