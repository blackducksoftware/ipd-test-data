Here is a Python program that accomplishes this task:

```python
def sum_even_numbers(numbers):
    sum = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            sum += num
    return sum

# Input list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Call the function and print the result
result = sum_even_numbers(numbers)
print("Sum of even numbers:", result)
```

You can replace the `numbers` list with any list of numbers you want to calculate the sum of even numbers for. The function `sum_even_numbers` loops through each number in the list and adds it to the sum only if it is even (i.e. its remainder when divided by 2 is 0). Finally, it returns the sum of all even numbers in the list.
