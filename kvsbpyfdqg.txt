Here is an example code snippet in Python that implements the described prompt:

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] < arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr

# Taking user input for list of numbers
numbers = [int(x) for x in input("Enter the numbers separated by spaces: ").split()]

# Sorting the list using Bubble Sort
sorted_numbers = bubble_sort(numbers)

# Output the sorted list
print("Sorted list in descending order:", sorted_numbers)
```

You can run this code snippet in a Python environment and test it with your list of numbers. Let me know if you need any further assistance or modifications!
