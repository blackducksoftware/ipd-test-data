Here is the Python program:

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    """
    Function to calculate the average of a list of numbers
    :param numbers: list of numbers
    :return: average of the numbers
    """
    if not numbers:
        raise ValueError("Empty list of numbers provided")
    
    total = sum(numbers)
    average = total / len(numbers)
    return average

def find_maximum(numbers):
    """
    Function to find the maximum number in a list of numbers
    :param numbers: list of numbers
    :return: maximum number
    """
    if not numbers:
        raise ValueError("Empty list of numbers provided")
    
    return max(numbers)

def find_minimum(numbers):
    """
    Function to find the minimum number in a list of numbers
    :param numbers: list of numbers
    :return: minimum number
    """
    if not numbers:
        raise ValueError("Empty list of numbers provided")
    
    return min(numbers)

# Input list of numbers
numbers = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ").split()
numbers = [float(num) for num in numbers]

try:
    # Calculate average
    average = calculate_average(numbers)
    print("Average:", average)

    # Find maximum number
    maximum = find_maximum(numbers)
    print("Maximum:", maximum)

    # Find minimum number
    minimum = find_minimum(numbers)
    print("Minimum:", minimum)

except ValueError as e:
    print("Error:", e)
except Exception as e:
    print("An error occurred:", e)
```

You can run this program in your Python environment by copying and pasting the code snippet above. This program will prompt you to enter a list of numbers, calculate the average, and output the maximum and minimum numbers in the list with appropriate error handling.
