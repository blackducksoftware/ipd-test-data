Here is an example of how you can implement this in Python:

```python
def calculate_sum(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total

# Test the function
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, -5]
print("Sum of numbers:", calculate_sum(numbers))
```

You can run this code in a Python environment and pass in any list of numbers to calculate the sum. This program will take in a list of numbers, iterate through each number in the list, and calculate the total sum of all the numbers.
