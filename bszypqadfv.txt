Here's a Python program that achieves this:

```python
def sum_of_even_numbers(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            total += num
    return total

# Input list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Calculate sum of even numbers
result = sum_of_even_numbers(numbers)

# Print the result
print("Sum of even numbers in the list:", result)
```

You can test this program by providing a list of numbers as input and checking the sum of all the even numbers in the list.
