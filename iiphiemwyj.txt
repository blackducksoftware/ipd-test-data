```python
import statistics

# Function to input list of numbers from user
def input_numbers():
    numbers = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by space: ")
    numbers = list(map(float, numbers.split()))
    return numbers

# Function to calculate mean, median, and mode
def calculate_statistics(numbers):
    mean = statistics.mean(numbers)
    median = statistics.median(numbers)
    mode = statistics.mode(numbers)
    return mean, median, mode

# Main program
numbers = input_numbers()
mean, median, mode = calculate_statistics(numbers)

print("Mean:", mean)
print("Median:", median)
print("Mode:", mode)
```

Example output:
```
Enter a list of numbers separated by space: 2 4 6 4 8
Mean: 4.8
Median: 4
Mode: 4
```
