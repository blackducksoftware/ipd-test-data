Here is an example solution to the prompt:

```python
def calculate_statistics(numbers):
    average = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    minimum = min(numbers)
    maximum = max(numbers)
    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
    
    return average, minimum, maximum, sorted_numbers

def main():
    numbers = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ").split()
    numbers = [int(num) for num in numbers]
    
    average, minimum, maximum, sorted_numbers = calculate_statistics(numbers)
    
    print(f"Average: {average}")
    print(f"Minimum: {minimum}")
    print(f"Maximum: {maximum}")
    print(f"Sorted list: {sorted_numbers}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

You can run this code in a Python environment, input a list of numbers, and the program will calculate the average, minimum, and maximum numbers in the list, sort the list in ascending order, and display the results.
