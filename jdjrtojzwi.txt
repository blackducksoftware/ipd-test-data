Here is a program that takes in a list of numbers and calculates the mean, median, and mode in Python:

```python
import statistics

def calculate_statistics(number_list):
    # Calculate the mean
    mean = sum(number_list) / len(number_list)
    
    # Calculate the median
    median = statistics.median(number_list)
    
    # Calculate the mode
    mode = statistics.mode(number_list)
    
    return mean, median, mode

# Input list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

mean, median, mode = calculate_statistics(numbers)

print("Mean:", mean)
print("Median:", median)
print("Mode:", mode)
```

In this program, we first import the `statistics` module to help us calculate the mean, median, and mode of the list of numbers. We define a function `calculate_statistics()` that takes in a list of numbers and returns the mean, median, and mode. We then input a list of numbers, call the `calculate_statistics()` function with the list, and print out the results.
