Sure! Here's a sample code that does exactly that:

```python
def create_movie_lists():
    movies = {}
    
    while True:
        movie_title = input("Enter the title of your favorite movie (type 'done' to finish): ")
        if movie_title.lower() == 'done':
            break
        genre = input("Enter the genre of the movie: ")
        
        if genre in movies:
            movies[genre].append(movie_title)
        else:
            movies[genre] = [movie_title]
    
    return movies

favorite_movies = create_movie_lists()

for genre, movies_list in favorite_movies.items():
    print(f"\n{genre} movies:")
    for movie in movies_list:
        print(movie)
```

This code defines a function `create_movie_lists` which prompts the user to input their favorite movies along with their genres. It then creates a dictionary `favorite_movies` where each key is a genre and the corresponding value is a list of movies in that genre. Finally, it prints out the movies organized by genre.

You can run this code in a Python environment and test it out by entering your favorite movies and their genres when prompted. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
