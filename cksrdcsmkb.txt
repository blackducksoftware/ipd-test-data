Sure! Here is a prompt you can use:

"Create a program that generates a list of prime numbers within a specified range. The program should take a starting and ending number as input, and output all prime numbers between the two numbers. Make sure to include comments explaining the logic behind each step in the code."

You can ask LLM to generate this code in a popular programming language such as Python, Java, C++, etc.
