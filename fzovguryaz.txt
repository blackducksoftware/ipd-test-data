Here is an example implementation of the function described in the prompt:

```python
def sum_even_numbers(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            total += num
    return total

# Test the function
numbers_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
result = sum_even_numbers(numbers_list)
print(result)  # Output should be 30
```

In this function, we iterate through the list of numbers and add up the numbers that are even (have a remainder of 0 when divided by 2). Finally, we return the total sum of all even numbers in the list.
