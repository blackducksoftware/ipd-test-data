Here is a simple Python program that simulates a game of rock, paper, scissors against the computer:

```python
import random

def get_user_choice():
    choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): ").lower()
    while choice not in ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]:
        choice = input("Invalid choice. Please enter rock, paper, or scissors: ").lower()
    return choice

def get_computer_choice():
    return random.choice(["rock", "paper", "scissors"])

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return "It's a tie!"
    elif (user_choice == "rock" and computer_choice == "scissors") or \
         (user_choice == "paper" and computer_choice == "rock") or \
         (user_choice == "scissors" and computer_choice == "paper"):
        return "You win!"
    else:
        return "Computer wins!"

def main():
    user_choice = get_user_choice()
    computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
    
    print(f"You chose: {user_choice}")
    print(f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}")
    
    result = determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

You can run this program in any Python environment and play a game of rock, paper, scissors against the computer. Just follow the instructions and enter your choice when prompted. The program will then generate a random choice for the computer and determine the winner based on the traditional rules of the game. Enjoy playing!
