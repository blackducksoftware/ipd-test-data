Here is a Python program that accomplishes the given prompt:

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = sum(numbers)
    return total / len(numbers)

def determine_above_below_average(numbers, avg):
    result = []
    for num in numbers:
        if num > avg:
            result.append("above")
        elif num < avg:
            result.append("below")
        else:
            result.append("equal")
    return result

# Get input from the user
num_list = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ")
numbers = [int(num) for num in num_list.split()]

# Calculate the average
avg = calculate_average(numbers)

# Determine if each number is above or below the average
result = determine_above_below_average(numbers, avg)

# Print the results
print(f"The average of the numbers is: {avg}")
for i, num in enumerate(numbers):
    print(f"{num} is {result[i]} the average.")
```

You can run this program in any Python environment and input a list of numbers separated by spaces when prompted. The program will then calculate the average of the numbers and determine if each number is above or below the average.
