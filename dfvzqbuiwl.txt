Sure! Here is a Python program that reads a list of numbers from the user, calculates the average, and outputs the result:

```python
# Read a list of numbers from the user
numbers = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ").split()

# Convert the input numbers to floats
numbers = [float(num) for num in numbers]

# Calculate the average of the numbers
average = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

# Output the average value
print("The average of the numbers is:", average)
```

You can run this program in a Python interpreter, enter a list of numbers separated by spaces, and it will calculate and output the average value.
