Sure, here is a Python script that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number using recursion:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    else:
        fib_seq = fibonacci(n - 1)
        fib_seq.append(fib_seq[-1] + fib_seq[-2])
        return fib_seq

n = int(input("Enter the number of Fibonacci numbers to generate: "))
fibonacci_sequence = fibonacci(n)

print("The Fibonacci sequence up to", n, "numbers is:")
print(fibonacci_sequence)
```

You can run this script and enter the number of Fibonacci numbers you want to generate, and it will print out the Fibonacci sequence up to that number.
