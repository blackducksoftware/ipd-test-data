Here is your Python program:

```python
def sum_even_numbers(numbers):
    even_sum = 0
    found_even = False
    
    for num in numbers:
        try:
            if int(num) % 2 == 0:
                even_sum += int(num)
                found_even = True
        except ValueError:
            print("Error: Non-numeric input found in the list")
            return
    
    if not found_even:
        print("No even numbers found in the list")
    else:
        print("Sum of even numbers:", even_sum)

# Taking input from the user
input_list = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ").split()

# Calling the function with input list
sum_even_numbers(input_list)
```

You can run this program in your Python environment and provide a list of numbers separated by spaces to get the sum of all the even numbers in the list. The program will also handle non-numeric inputs and display a message if no even numbers are found in the list.
