Here is a Python implementation of a simple tic-tac-toe game:

```python
def print_board(board):
    for row in board:
        print(" | ".join(row))
        print("-" * 5)

def check_winner(board, player):
    for row in board:
        if all([cell == player for cell in row]):
            return True
    for col in range(3):
        if all([board[row][col] == player for row in range(3)]):
            return True
    if all([board[i][i] == player for i in range(3)]) or all([board[i][2-i] == player for i in range(3)]):
        return True
    return False

def tic_tac_toe():
    board = [[" " for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]
    player = "X"
    moves = 0

    while moves < 9:
        print_board(board)
        row = int(input(f"Player {player}, enter the row number (0-2): "))
        col = int(input(f"Player {player}, enter the col number (0-2): "))

        if 0 <= row < 3 and 0 <= col < 3 and board[row][col] == " ":
            board[row][col] = player
            moves += 1
            if check_winner(board, player):
                print_board(board)
                print(f"Congratulations! Player {player} wins!")
                break
            player = "O" if player == "X" else "X"
        else:
            print("Invalid move. Please try again.")

    if moves == 9:
        print_board(board)
        print("It's a tie!")

    restart = input("Do you want to play again? (yes/no) ")
    if restart.lower() == "yes":
        tic_tac_toe()

tic_tac_toe()
```

You can run this program in a Python environment to play the tic-tac-toe game. Just follow the instructions on the screen to make your moves and enjoy the game!
