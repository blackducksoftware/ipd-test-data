Here is a simple Python program that generates a Fibonacci sequence up to a user-specified number:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    
    while fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2] <= n:
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])

    return fib_sequence

if __name__ == "__main__":
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    fib_sequence = fibonacci(num)
    
    print("Fibonacci sequence up to", num, ":")
    print(fib_sequence)
```

When you run this program, it will prompt you to enter a number. The program will then generate the Fibonacci sequence up to that number and print out the sequence.
