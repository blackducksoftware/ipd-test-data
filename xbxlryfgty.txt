Here is a simple Python code that prompts the user for the length of the Fibonacci sequence and then generates the sequence up to that length:

```python
def fibonacci_sequence(length):
    sequence = [0, 1]
    while len(sequence) < length:
        sequence.append(sequence[-1] + sequence[-2])
    return sequence

length = int(input("Enter the length of the Fibonacci sequence: "))
fibonacci_seq = fibonacci_sequence(length)
print(fibonacci_seq)
```

You can copy and paste this code into a Python interpreter or IDE and run it to generate the Fibonacci sequence of the specified length.
