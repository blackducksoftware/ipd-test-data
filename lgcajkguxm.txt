Sure! Here is the code generated by the language model:

```python
def filter_and_square_numbers(numbers):
    filtered_numbers = [num ** 2 for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
    sum_filtered_numbers = sum(filtered_numbers)
    
    return sum_filtered_numbers

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
result = filter_and_square_numbers(numbers)

print(result)
```

This code takes a list of numbers as input, filters out the odd numbers, squares the even numbers, calculates the sum of the filtered and squared numbers, and finally prints the sum as the output. Feel free to customize the input list to test the code with different sets of numbers!
