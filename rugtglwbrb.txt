Sure! Here is a prompt you can ask LLM:

"Generate a function in Python that takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list. Additionally, the function should also print out the count of even numbers in the list. Make sure to include error handling for cases where the input is not a valid list of numbers."
