Sure! Here's a Python script that uses a for loop to iterate over a list of numbers and calculates the sum of all the even numbers in the list:

```python
# Define a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Initialize a variable to store the sum of even numbers
even_sum = 0

# Iterate over the list of numbers
for num in numbers:
    # Check if the number is even
    if num % 2 == 0:
        # Add the even number to the sum
        even_sum += num

# Print the total sum of even numbers
print("The sum of even numbers in the list is:", even_sum)
```

This script will iterate over the list of numbers, check if each number is even, and add the even numbers to the `even_sum` variable. Finally, it will print out the total sum of all the even numbers in the list.
