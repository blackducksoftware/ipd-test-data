Here is a simple Python program that calculates the average of a list of numbers input by the user:

```python
# Function to calculate the average of a list of numbers
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = sum(numbers)
    average = total / len(numbers)
    return average

# Main program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        numbers = [int(num) for num in input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ").split()]
        avg = calculate_average(numbers)
        print("Average of the numbers is:", avg)
    except ValueError:
        print("Please enter valid numbers separated by spaces.")
```

You can copy and paste this code into a Python interpreter or a Python file to run it. The program prompts the user to enter a list of numbers separated by spaces, calculates the average of those numbers, and then prints out the result. If the user enters invalid input (e.g., non-numeric values), the program will print an error message.
