Here is the Python program that reads a list of numbers from user input, calculates the mean, median, and mode of the list, and then outputs the results:

```python
import statistics

# Function to calculate the mode of a list
def calculate_mode(numbers):
    counts = {}
    for num in numbers:
        if num in counts:
            counts[num] += 1
        else:
            counts[num] = 1
    mode = max(counts, key=counts.get)
    return mode

# Read the list of numbers from user input
try:
    numbers = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ")
    numbers = list(map(float, numbers.split()))
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter numbers separated by spaces.")
    exit()

# Calculate the mean, median, and mode of the list
mean = statistics.mean(numbers)
median = statistics.median(numbers)
mode = calculate_mode(numbers)

# Output the results
print(f"Mean: {mean}")
print(f"Median: {median}")
print(f"Mode: {mode}")
```

This program uses the `statistics` module in Python to calculate the mean and median of the list of numbers. It also includes a function `calculate_mode` to calculate the mode of the list. Error handling is included to handle cases where the user enters invalid input. Each section of the code is explained with comments for clarity.
