Prompt: Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the average of the numbers in the list. The program should also calculate and display the maximum and minimum numbers in the list.

Expected output:
- Calculated average of the list of numbers
- Maximum number in the list
- Minimum number in the list

Language: Python

Example input:
[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

Example output:
Average: 30.0
Maximum: 50
Minimum: 10

Code:
```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = sum(numbers)
    return total / len(numbers)

def find_maximum(numbers):
    return max(numbers)

def find_minimum(numbers):
    return min(numbers)

numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
average = calculate_average(numbers)
maximum = find_maximum(numbers)
minimum = find_minimum(numbers)

print(f"Average: {average}")
print(f"Maximum: {maximum}")
print(f"Minimum: {minimum}")
```
