Here is the Python script that scrapes data from a website using BeautifulSoup and saves it into a CSV file:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import csv

# URL of the website to scrape
url = 'http://example.com'

try:
    # Send a GET request to the website
    response = requests.get(url)

    # Parse the HTML content of the website
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

    # Find and extract the data you want to scrape
    data = []
    for item in soup.find_all('div', class_='item'):
        data.append(item.text)

    # Save the data into a CSV file
    with open('data.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
        csv_writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
        for row in data:
            csv_writer.writerow([row])

    print('Data scraped and saved successfully!')

except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print('Error: Failed to make a request to the website')
except Exception as e:
    print(f'Error: {e}')
```

Please note that you will need to replace the URL `'http://example.com'` and the HTML tags like `'div'` and class name `'item'` with the valid ones from the website you want to scrape.
