Here is the Python code for the prompt you provided:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

while True:
    try:
        num = int(input("Enter a non-negative integer to calculate its factorial: "))
        if num < 0:
            print("Please enter a non-negative integer.")
            continue
        result = factorial(num)
        print(f"The factorial of {num} is {result}")
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid non-negative integer.")
    choice = input("Do you want to calculate another factorial? (yes/no): ")
    if choice.lower() != 'yes':
        break
```

You can run this code in a Python interpreter or an IDE to prompt the user to enter a non-negative integer, calculate its factorial, and ask if they want to calculate another factorial. It handles input validation to ensure that the user enters a non-negative integer. Let me know if you need any more help with this!
