Here is a sample Python program that achieves this:

```python
def calculate_average(num_list):
    total = sum(num_list)
    average = total / len(num_list)
    return average

# Take input from the user
input_list = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by a space: ")
num_list = [int(num) for num in input_list.split()]

# Calculate the average
result = calculate_average(num_list)

print("The average of the numbers in the list is:", result)
```

You can run this program and input a list of numbers separated by spaces. The program will calculate the average of all the numbers in the list and display it as output.
