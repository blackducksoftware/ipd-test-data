Here's a Python program that accomplishes the task:

```python
# Read a list of numbers from the user
numbers = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ").split()

# Convert the input numbers to integers
numbers = [int(num) for num in numbers]

# Calculate the sum and average of the numbers
total = sum(numbers)
average = total / len(numbers)

# Output the sum and average to the user
print(f"The sum of the numbers is: {total}")
print(f"The average of the numbers is: {average}")
```

You can copy and paste this code into a Python interpreter or IDE, run it, and then input a list of numbers to see the sum and average calculated and displayed.
