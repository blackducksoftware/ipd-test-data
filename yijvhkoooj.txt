Here is the Python code that accomplishes the task:

```python
def fibonacci_sequence(num_terms):
    if not isinstance(num_terms, int):
        raise ValueError("Number of terms must be an integer.")
    if num_terms <= 0:
        return []
    if num_terms > 20:
        num_terms = 20
    
    fibonacci = [0, 1]
    for _ in range(2, num_terms):
        next_term = fibonacci[-1] + fibonacci[-2]
        fibonacci.append(next_term)
    
    return fibonacci

# Prompt user for input
try:
    num_terms = int(input("Enter the number of terms for Fibonacci sequence calculation (up to 20): "))
    result = fibonacci_sequence(num_terms)
    print("Fibonacci sequence:", result)
except ValueError as e:
    print("Error:", e)
```

You can run this code and input the number of terms you want to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to, keeping in mind the limitation of a maximum of 20 terms. The code also includes error handling for non-integer inputs.
