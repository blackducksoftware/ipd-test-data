Sure! Here is the prompt you can ask LLM:

"Generate a program in Python that simulates a simple bank account system. The program should include functions to deposit money, withdraw money, check balance, and display transaction history. It should also have error handling for invalid inputs and a loop to allow the user to perform multiple transactions. Please include comments to explain the purpose of each function and any key logic in the program."
