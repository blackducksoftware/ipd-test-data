add a bit for the response
Sure, here is a prompt you can ask LLM for generating 20+ lines of code in Python:

Prompt: Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of the even numbers in the list.

Expected output:
```python
def sum_even_numbers(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            total += num
    return total

numbers = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
print(sum_even_numbers(numbers))
``` 

Feel free to adjust the prompt if you'd like LLM to generate code in a different programming language.
