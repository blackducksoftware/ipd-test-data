Prompt: Create a program that takes in a list of numbers from the user and outputs the sum of all the even numbers in the list. 

LLM Response (Python):
```python
# Function to calculate sum of even numbers
def sum_of_even_numbers(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            total += num
    return total

# Take input from user
num_list = list(map(int, input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ").split()))

# Calculate sum of even numbers
result = sum_of_even_numbers(num_list)

# Output the result
print(f"The sum of even numbers in the list is: {result}")
```
