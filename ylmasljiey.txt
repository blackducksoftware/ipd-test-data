Here is the Python program based on the prompt:

```python
def fibonacci_sequence(n):
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    while fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2] <= n:
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])
    return fib_sequence

def main():
    user_input = int(input("Enter a number to generate Fibonacci sequence up to: "))
    fib_sequence = fibonacci_sequence(user_input)

    print("Fibonacci sequence up to", user_input, ":")
    print(fib_sequence)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This program defines a function `fibonacci_sequence(n)` that generates Fibonacci numbers up to `n` and a `main()` function that takes user input and prints the generated Fibonacci sequence. When executed, the program will ask the user for a number and then output the Fibonacci sequence up to that number.
