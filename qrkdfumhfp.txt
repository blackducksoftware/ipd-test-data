```python
import random

# Generate a list of 100 random numbers between 1 and 1000
random_numbers = [random.randint(1, 1000) for _ in range(100)]

# Calculate the average of the random numbers
average = sum(random_numbers) / len(random_numbers)

# Print out the original list of numbers
print("Original List of Random Numbers:")
print(random_numbers)

# Print out the average of the random numbers
print("\nAverage of Random Numbers:", average)
```

LLM can use this prompt to write a Python program that generates a list of 100 random numbers between 1 and 1000, calculates their average, and prints out both the list of numbers and the average.
