Sure! Here is an example of a Python program that accomplishes that:

```python
def factorial(num):
    if num == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return num * factorial(num - 1)

def main():
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    
    if num < 0:
        print("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.")
    else:
        result = factorial(num)
        print(f"The factorial of {num} is: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This program defines a function `factorial` that calculates the factorial of a given number recursively. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a number, calculates the factorial using the `factorial` function, and then displays the result. The program also includes a check to handle negative numbers for which factorial is not defined.
