Sure! Here is a prompt you can use:

Prompt: "Generate a program in Python that takes a list of numbers, sorts them in descending order, and then calculates the sum of the first 10 numbers in the sorted list."

You can ask LLM to generate the code based on this prompt and it should produce 20+ lines of Python code for you.
