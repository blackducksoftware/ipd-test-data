Here is a possible prompt you can ask LLM:

```
Can you solve the following coding challenge:

Create a function in Python that takes in a list of integers and returns a new list with only the even numbers squared. Additionally, the function should sort the resulting list in descending order.

For example:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
Output: [64, 36, 16, 4]

Please provide both the function code and an example test case.

Thank you!
