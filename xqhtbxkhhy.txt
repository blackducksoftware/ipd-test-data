Sure! Here is the Python code generated based on the prompt:

```python
# Input list of numbers
input_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Using list comprehension to filter even numbers
output_list = [num for num in input_list if num % 2 == 0]

# Output the new list containing only even numbers
print("Input List:", input_list)
print("Even Numbers List:", output_list)
```

This code takes a list of numbers as input and outputs a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list using list comprehension.
