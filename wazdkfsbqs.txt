Certainly! Here is a Python program that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a user-specified number:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    while fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2] <= n:
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])
    
    return fib_sequence

# Get user input
num = int(input("Enter a number to calculate Fibonacci sequence up to: "))

fib_result = fibonacci(num)
print("Fibonacci sequence up to", num, "is:", fib_result)
```

You can run this program in a Python environment and input the desired number to get the Fibonacci sequence up to that number.
