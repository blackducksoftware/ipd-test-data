Here is a Python code generated based on the prompt:

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = sum(numbers)
    average = total / len(numbers)
    return average

def find_pairs(numbers, target):
    pairs = []
    seen = set()
    
    for num in numbers:
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            pairs.append((complement, num))
        seen.add(num)
    
    return pairs

# Input list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
target = 8

# Calculate average
average = calculate_average(numbers)
print("Average of numbers:", average)

# Find pairs that add up to target
pairs = find_pairs(numbers, target)
print("Pairs that add up to target number:", pairs)
```

This code calculates the average of a list of numbers and then finds pairs of numbers in the list that add up to a target number.
