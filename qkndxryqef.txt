```python
def sum_even_numbers(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            total += num
    return total

# Taking input from the user
numbers = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ")
numbers = list(map(int, numbers.split()))

result = sum_even_numbers(numbers)
print("Sum of even numbers in the list:", result)
```

Example:
```
Input: Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: 1 2 3 4 5 6
Output: Sum of even numbers in the list: 12
