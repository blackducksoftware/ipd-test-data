Here is a Python program that takes a list of numbers as input and outputs the average, minimum, and maximum numbers in the list:

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = sum(numbers)
    average = total / len(numbers)
    return average

def find_min(numbers):
    return min(numbers)

def find_max(numbers):
    return max(numbers)

# Input list of numbers
numbers = [int(x) for x in input("Enter a list of numbers separated by a space: ").split()]

# Calculate average, minimum, and maximum
average = calculate_average(numbers)
min_num = find_min(numbers)
max_num = find_max(numbers)

# Output results
print("Average:", average)
print("Minimum:", min_num)
print("Maximum:", max_num)
```

You can run this program by copying and pasting it into a Python interpreter or an IDE like PyCharm. When prompted, enter a list of numbers separated by a space, and the program will output the average, minimum, and maximum of those numbers.
