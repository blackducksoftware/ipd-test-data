Here's a Python program that accomplishes the task:

```python
def sum_of_even_numbers(numbers):
    even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
    
    if even_numbers:
        return sum(even_numbers)
    else:
        return -1

# Input list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
result = sum_of_even_numbers(numbers)
print("Sum of even numbers:", result)

numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
result = sum_of_even_numbers(numbers)
print("Sum of even numbers:", result)
```

You can run this program in a Python environment, and it will calculate the sum of even numbers in the input lists provided.
