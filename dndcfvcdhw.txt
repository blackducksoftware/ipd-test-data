Sure! Here is the Python code for the program that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

# Test the program with a given number
num = 5
result = factorial(num)
print(f"The factorial of {num} is: {result}")
```

You can run this code in a Python environment to calculate the factorial of a given number. Just replace the `num` variable with the number you want to calculate the factorial for.
