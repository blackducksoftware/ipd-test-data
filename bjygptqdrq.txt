Here is a sample code in Python that accomplishes the task described in the prompt:

```python
def find_numbers_greater_than_mean(num_list):
    mean = sum(num_list) / len(num_list)
    result = [num for num in num_list if num > mean]
    return result

# Example usage
numbers = [10, 15, 20, 25, 30]
result_list = find_numbers_greater_than_mean(numbers)
print("Numbers greater than the mean:", result_list)
```

You can replace the `numbers` list with any list of numbers you want to test the code with. The function `find_numbers_greater_than_mean` calculates the mean of the input list of numbers and then creates a new list containing only those numbers that are greater than the mean. Finally, it prints out the numbers greater than the mean.
