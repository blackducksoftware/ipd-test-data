Here is a Python program that prompts the user to enter a number and then outputs the reverse of that number:

```python
def reverse_number(number):
    is_negative = False
    if number < 0:
        is_negative = True
        number = abs(number)

    reversed_number = int(str(number)[::-1])

    if is_negative:
        reversed_number *= -1
    
    return reversed_number

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
reversed_num = reverse_number(num)

print(f"The reverse of {num} is {reversed_num}")
```

This program defines a function `reverse_number` that takes a number as input and returns the reverse of that number. It first checks if the number is negative and stores this information. Then, it converts the number to a string, reverses it using slicing, and converts it back to an integer. Finally, if the original number was negative, it multiplies the reversed number by -1 to maintain the sign.

The program then prompts the user to enter a number, calls the `reverse_number` function on it, and prints out the result.
