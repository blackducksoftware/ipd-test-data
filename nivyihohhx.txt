add a bit for the response
Sure! Here is a prompt you could use to ask LLM to generate 20+ lines of code in Python:

"Can you generate a Python program that takes a list of numbers as input, sorts it in descending order, calculates the mean and standard deviation of the numbers, and then prints out the sorted list, mean, and standard deviation?"

Feel free to modify or provide any specific requirements as needed!
