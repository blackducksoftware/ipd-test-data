Here's an example implementation in Python:

```python
import random

class DeckOfCards:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cards = []
        for suit in ['Hearts', 'Diamonds', 'Clubs', 'Spades']:
            for rank in range(1, 14):
                self.cards.append((rank, suit))

    def shuffle(self):
        random.shuffle(self.cards)

    def deal(self, num_cards):
        dealt_cards = []
        for _ in range(num_cards):
            dealt_cards.append(self.cards.pop(0))
        return dealt_cards

    def display_remaining_cards(self):
        print("Remaining cards in the deck:")
        for card in self.cards:
            print(f"{card[0]} of {card[1]}")

# Testing the deck of cards simulation
deck = DeckOfCards()
deck.shuffle()
player_hand = deck.deal(5)
print("Player's hand:")
for card in player_hand:
    print(f"{card[0]} of {card[1]}")
deck.display_remaining_cards()
```

You can run this program in Python to simulate a deck of playing cards, shuffle the deck, deal a specified number of cards to a player, and display the remaining cards in the deck. Feel free to modify or expand upon this code as needed!
