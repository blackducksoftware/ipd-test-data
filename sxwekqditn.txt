Prompt: "Can you write a program that takes user input for a list of numbers, calculates the average of the numbers, and then outputs whether the average is greater than, less than, or equal to a specified value?"

Here is an example code snippet in Python:

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = sum(numbers)
    average = total / len(numbers)
    return average

user_input = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ")
numbers = [int(num) for num in user_input.split()]

specified_value = int(input("Enter a value to compare the average to: "))

average = calculate_average(numbers)

if average > specified_value:
    print("The average is greater than the specified value.")
elif average < specified_value:
    print("The average is less than the specified value.")
else:
    print("The average is equal to the specified value.")
```
