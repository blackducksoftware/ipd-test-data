Here is a sample code in Python that accomplishes the task:

```python
import math

def calculate_mean(numbers):
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

def calculate_standard_deviation(numbers):
    mean = calculate_mean(numbers)
    variance = sum([(x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers]) / len(numbers)
    return math.sqrt(variance)

numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

mean = calculate_mean(numbers)
std_dev = calculate_standard_deviation(numbers)

print("Mean:", mean)
print("Standard Deviation:", std_dev)
```

This code defines two functions, `calculate_mean` and `calculate_standard_deviation`, which calculate the mean and standard deviation of a list of numbers, respectively. It then applies these functions to the list `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]` and prints out the results.
