Here is an example of a Python program that calculates the average of a list of numbers using a function:

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = sum(numbers)
    return total / len(numbers)

# Input list of numbers
numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]

# Calculate average using the function
average = calculate_average(numbers)

print("The average of the numbers is:", average)
```

When you run this Python program with the input list `[5, 10, 15, 20, 25]`, it will output `The average of the numbers is: 15.0`.
