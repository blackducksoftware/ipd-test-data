Bubble sort algorithm:

Start at the beginning of the list
Compare the first two elements of the list
If the first element is larger than the second element, swap them
Move to the next pair of elements and repeat steps 2 and 3 until the end of the list
Repeat steps 2-4 for each element in the list
Continue this process until no more swaps need to be made
The list is now sorted.
