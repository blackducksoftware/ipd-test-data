```python
def fibonacci(n):
    fib_sequence = []
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        fib_sequence.append(a)
        a, b = b, a + b
    return fib_sequence

n = int(input("Enter the number of terms for Fibonacci sequence: "))
fib_sequence = fibonacci(n)

print("Fibonacci sequence:")
print(fib_sequence)
```
This program takes a user input for the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence and calculates the sequence up to that number of terms. The `fibonacci()` function calculates the sequence and returns it as a list, which is then printed out to the user.
