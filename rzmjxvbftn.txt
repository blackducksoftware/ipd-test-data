Sure! Here is a prompt you can ask LLM:

"Please generate a program in Python that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list with only the even numbers squared. The program should include error handling for non-numeric input and should handle both positive and negative numbers. It should also include a function to calculate the sum of the squared even numbers in the list."
