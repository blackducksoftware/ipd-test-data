Here is a Python program that does exactly that:

```python
from statistics import mean, median, mode

# Function to calculate mean, median, and mode of a list of numbers
def calculate_statistics(nums):
    sorted_nums = sorted(nums)
    mean_value = mean(nums)
    median_value = median(nums)
    mode_value = mode(nums)

    print("Sorted list: ", sorted_nums)
    print("Mean: ", mean_value)
    print("Median: ", median_value)
    print("Mode: ", mode_value)

# Main program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    nums = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ").split()
    nums = [int(num) for num in nums]

    calculate_statistics(nums)
```

You can run this program by saving it to a Python file (e.g., stats_calculator.py) and running it using a Python interpreter. The program will prompt you to enter a list of numbers separated by spaces, and it will then calculate and display the mean, median, and mode of the values, along with the sorted list in ascending order.
