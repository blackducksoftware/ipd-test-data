Here is a sample program in Python that accomplishes this task:

```python
def calculate_sum_and_average(numbers):
    sum_numbers = sum(numbers)
    average = sum_numbers / len(numbers)
    
    return sum_numbers, average

input_numbers = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ").split()
numbers = [int(num) for num in input_numbers]

sum_numbers, average = calculate_sum_and_average(numbers)

print(f"The sum of the numbers is: {sum_numbers}")
print(f"The average of the numbers is: {average}")
```

You can run this program in a Python environment or an online compiler to input a list of numbers and calculate the sum and average.
