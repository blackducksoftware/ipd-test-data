This Python program generates Fibonacci numbers up to a specified limit and calculates the sum of all even numbers in the list. The `fibonacci()` function generates Fibonacci numbers up to the limit provided and returns a list of Fibonacci numbers. The `sum_even_fibonacci()` function calculates the sum of all even Fibonacci numbers in the list. 

In this example, the limit for Fibonacci numbers is set to 100. The program first generates Fibonacci numbers up to the specified limit using the `fibonacci()` function. Then, it calculates the sum of all even Fibonacci numbers using the `sum_even_fibonacci()` function.

Finally, the program prints the list of Fibonacci numbers up to the limit and the sum of all even Fibonacci numbers.
