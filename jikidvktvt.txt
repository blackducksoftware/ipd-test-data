Here is a Python program that calculates the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 100 and prints the result:

```python
# Initialize a variable to store the sum of even numbers
sum_even = 0

# Iterate through the numbers from 1 to 100
for i in range(1, 101):
    # Check if the number is even
    if i % 2 == 0:
        # Add the even number to the sum
        sum_even += i

# Print the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 100
print("The sum of all even numbers from 1 to 100 is:", sum_even)
```

You can copy and paste this code into a Python interpreter or IDE and run it to see the result.
