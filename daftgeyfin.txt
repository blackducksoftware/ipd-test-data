Here is a program in Python that accomplishes the task:

```python
def calculate_numbers(numbers):
    sum_even = 0
    odd_numbers = []
    count_odd = 0
    
    for num in numbers:
        try:
            num = int(num)
            if num % 2 == 0:
                sum_even += num
            else:
                odd_numbers.append(num)
                count_odd += 1
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input! Please enter only numeric values.")
            return
    
    if count_odd != 0:
        average_odd = sum(odd_numbers) / count_odd
        print("Sum of even numbers:", sum_even)
        print("Average of odd numbers:", average_odd)
    else:
        print("There are no odd numbers in the list.")

# Taking input from the user
numbers = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by space: ").split()

calculate_numbers(numbers)
```

You can run this program in a Python environment and provide the list of numbers as input. The program will calculate the sum of even numbers and the average of odd numbers in the list, while also handling errors for non-numeric inputs.
