Here is the code in Python that sorts a list of numbers in descending order and calculates the average of the first 10 elements of the sorted list:

```python
# List of numbers
numbers = [19, 27, 13, 5, 21, 34, 17, 8, 25, 10]

# Sorting the list in descending order
numbers.sort(reverse=True)

# Calculating the average of the first 10 elements
average = sum(numbers[:10]) / 10

print("Sorted List in Descending Order:", numbers)
print("Average of the first 10 elements:", average)
```

You can run this code in a Python environment to see the sorted list and the average of the first 10 elements. Let me know if you need any further assistance or modifications to the code!
