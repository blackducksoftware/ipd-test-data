Here is the Python program generated by LLM for the prompt:

```python
# Function to calculate square of each number in a list
def square_numbers(nums):
    squared_nums = [num ** 2 for num in nums]
    return squared_nums

# Input list of numbers
input_numbers = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ")
numbers_list = list(map(int, input_numbers.split()))

# Calculate square of each number in the list
squared_list = square_numbers(numbers_list)

# Output the squared numbers
print("Squared numbers:")
for num in squared_list:
    print(num)
```

You can run this program by providing a list of numbers as input and it will output the square of each number in the list.
