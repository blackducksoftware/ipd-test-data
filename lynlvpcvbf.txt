Sure! Here is a prompt you can use to generate 20+ lines of code in Python:

Write a program that takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of all even numbers in the list. If there are no even numbers in the list, the program should return 0.

You can ask LLM to generate the code based on this prompt.
