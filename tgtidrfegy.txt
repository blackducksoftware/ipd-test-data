Here is a Python program that takes in a list of numbers and outputs the sum of all odd numbers in the list:

```python
def sum_of_odd_numbers(numbers):
    odd_sum = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 != 0:
            odd_sum += num
    return odd_sum

# Taking input from the user
numbers = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ")
numbers_list = list(map(int, numbers.split()))

# Calculating the sum of odd numbers
result = sum_of_odd_numbers(numbers_list)

print("Sum of all odd numbers in the list is:", result)
```

You can run this program and enter a list of numbers separated by spaces when prompted. The program will then calculate the sum of all odd numbers in the list and display the result.
