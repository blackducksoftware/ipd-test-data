Here is a sample program that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of all odd numbers in the list:

```python
def sum_of_odd_numbers(numbers):
    sum_odd = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 != 0:
            sum_odd += num
    return sum_odd

# Example input
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
result = sum_of_odd_numbers(numbers)
print(result)
```

You can run this program with your own list of numbers to calculate the sum of all odd numbers in the list.
