Sure! Below is an example code in Python that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data for a specified city:

```python
import requests

def get_weather(city):
    api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'  # You can get an API key by signing up at https://openweathermap.org/
    base_url = 'http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q='

    complete_url = base_url + city + '&appid=' + api_key

    response = requests.get(complete_url)
    data = response.json()

    if data['cod'] == 200:
        main = data['main']
        weather = data['weather'][0]
        temperature = main['temp'] - 273.15  # Convert temperature from Kelvin to Celsius
        description = weather['description']

        print(f"Weather in {city}:")
        print(f"Temperature: {temperature:.2f} Â°C")
        print(f"Description: {description.capitalize()}")
    else:
        print("City not found. Please try again.")

city = input("Enter a city: ")
get_weather(city)
```

Make sure to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.
This code will retrieve the weather data for the specified city and display the current temperature and weather description. You can run the program and input any city to get the weather forecast.
