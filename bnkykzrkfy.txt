Certainly! Here's a Python program that accomplishes the task you've described:

```python
def calculate_statistics():
    numbers = []
    
    try:
        n = int(input("Enter the number of elements in the list: "))
        
        for i in range(n):
            num = float(input(f"Enter number {i+1}: "))
            numbers.append(num)
        
        average = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
        max_num = max(numbers)
        min_num = min(numbers)
        
        print(f"Average: {average}")
        print(f"Maximum: {max_num}")
        print(f"Minimum: {min_num}")
        
    except ValueError:
        print("Error: Please enter a valid number.")
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Error: Cannot calculate average of an empty list.")

calculate_statistics()
```

You can run this program in a Python environment and follow the prompts to input a list of numbers. The program will then calculate the average, maximum, and minimum values, and output the results. Error handling is in place to handle invalid inputs such as non-numeric entries or an empty list.
