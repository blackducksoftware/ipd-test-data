Sure! Here is a prompt you can use to ask LLM to generate 20+ lines of code in Python:

Create a Python program that takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the sum of all the even numbers in the list. The program should then print out the sum as well as a message indicating whether the sum is even or odd. Additionally, the program should include error handling to handle cases where the user enters invalid input (e.g. non-numeric values).
