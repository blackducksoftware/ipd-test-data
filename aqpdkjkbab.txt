Here is a Python program that generates a Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms:

```python
def fibonacci_sequence(num_terms):
    if num_terms <= 0:
        return []
    elif num_terms == 1:
        return [0]
    elif num_terms == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    
    sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, num_terms):
        sequence.append(sequence[i-1] + sequence[i-2])
    
    return sequence

num_terms = int(input("Enter the number of terms for the Fibonacci sequence: "))
fib_sequence = fibonacci_sequence(num_terms)

print("Fibonacci sequence with", num_terms, "terms:")
print(", ".join(map(str, fib_sequence)))
```

You can run this program in a Python environment and input the number of terms you want to generate in the Fibonacci sequence. The program will then display the sequence in a comma-separated format.
