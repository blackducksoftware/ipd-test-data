Sure! Here is a prompt you can ask LLM for generating 20+ lines of Python code:

"Can you generate a Python script that extracts data from a CSV file, performs some data cleaning and transformation operations, and then visualizes the processed data using matplotlib library? Please include error handling and comments for clarity."

Feel free to customize the prompt based on your specific requirements or preferences.
