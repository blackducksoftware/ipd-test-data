Sure! Here is a prompt you can ask LLM for generating 20+ lines of code in Python:

Prompt: Write a Python program that takes in a list of numbers and returns a new list with only the even numbers, sorted in descending order.

Expected output:
```python
def filter_even_numbers(numbers):
    even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
    even_numbers.sort(reverse=True)
    return even_numbers

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
result = filter_even_numbers(numbers)
print(result)
```
