```python
# Input list of numbers from user
numbers = input("Enter numbers separated by spaces: ")
numbers_list = numbers.split()

# Convert numbers from string to float
numbers_list = [float(num) for num in numbers_list]

# Calculate average
avg = sum(numbers_list) / len(numbers_list)

# Print average
print("Average: ", avg)
``` 

This program prompts the user to enter a list of numbers separated by spaces, then splits the input string into a list of numbers. It then calculates the average of these numbers by summing them up and dividing by the total count of numbers. Finally, it prints out the average value.
